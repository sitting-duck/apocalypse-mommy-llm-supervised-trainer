To quote Watson: ""This process is life force and the reverse of the second law of thermodynamics; it is the vital force: Vril."" This is one huge difference between the physics of Schappeller and Schauberger and the physics of the Nineteenth Century. The physics of the Nineteenth Century explain everything in terms of the inanimate. Laws of physics are written using inanimate examples. Chemical reactions are described which stem from inanimate models. Animate models are simply made to conform with the inanimate assuming that life is just a special case which eventually will be shown to be nothing but chemistry and so subject to the same Second Thermodynamic Law as the inanimate. Schappeller and Schauberger both say in their own ways that this is not so.

explain diagnostic testing can provide results within 30 minutes,"diagnostic testing can provide results within 30 minutes. Reliability and interpretation of rapid test results The reliability of rapid diagnostic tests depends largely on the conditions under which they are used. Understanding some basic considerations can minimize being misled by false-positive or false-negative results. Median sensitivities of rapid diagnostic tests are generally ~70%–75% when compared with viral culture, but median specificities of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza are approximately 90%–95%. False-positive (and true negative) results are more likely to occur when disease prevalence in the community is low, which is generally at the beginning and end of the influenza season. False-negative (and true positive) results are more likely to occur when disease prevalence is high in the community, which is typically at the height of the influenza season. Minimizing the occurrence of false results • Use rapid diagnostic tests that have high sensitivity and specificity. • Collect specimens as early in the illness as possible (within 4–5 days of symptom onset). • Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, including those for handling of specimens. • Consider sending specimens for viral",0,-4.070394039154053,0.016784142702817917,0

However, the loading time is five times faster than Figure 13, and 12 times faster that the core's period. The loading time is so fast in relation to the period that a strong, second harmonic has been introduced into the vibrating motion. Now the core actually reverses direction several times during its fundamental period of 0.00248 seconds. Click Figure 17 several more times and notice these reversals. These reversals cause hinge flakes, which are also very common at quarries because of the use of rock impactors. I will have more to say about hinge flakes in a later section.

explain is a climbing plant that may cover small shrubs and trees,"Compost can be turned into the soil in the spring in preparation for planting. If only a small amount of compost is available, it can be incorporated in the seed furrow or a handful can be added to each transplant hole of annuals, perennials, or vegetables. Large amounts of compost can be used to plant trees, shrubs and vegetable gardens, or to repair or replace lawn area. Mulch • Superior to bark mulch in that it is a slow release source of plant nutrients and beneficial microbes. Spread a two to four inch layer around plants, trees, shrubs and exposed slopes. This will deter weeds, prevent erosion, conserve water, and attract earthworms. Potting Mix • Compost can be combined with equal parts of sand and soil to create an excellent potting mix. The compost should be screened to ensure that only fine particles are used in the mix. Finished compost is not soil and cannot be used alone as seed germination or potting media.

"explain on the type, formation and speed of the aircraft, surface winds, the","widely different problems. A runway on salt-water ice for a given aircraft type requires double the length, and greater thickness than on fresh-water ice. Fresh-water ice is normally smooth, and has greater strength and salt-water ice. During spring break-up, use of the airfields in the early hours of the morning is recommended because normally the airstrip is in the best condition after the night freezing. When aircraft are parked on ice strips or sites, the ice should be checked for deformation periodically. Distance between parked aircraft is a function of ice type, thickness, and aircraft bearing pressure. Aircraft to be de-iced with anti-freezing solutions should be moved from the runway or parking area to prevent contamination and weakening of the surface by excess solution. Preparation of Landing Sites for Helicopters The amount of effort exerted towards improving sites will depend on their intended use. Little effort is required on the tundra, except in summer conditions when it may be desirable to prepare the ground with oil or some other form of soil stabilizer.

During the contractions the mother bears down (pushes) with all her strength. Between contractions, she may seem very tired and half asleep. To bear down, the mother should take a deep breath and push hard with her stomach muscles, as if she were having a bowel movement.

Leaves vary in length from 5 to 30 cm (2 - 12 inches), and are roughly 6 to 13 mm (1/4 to 1/2 inch wide). Meadow Foxtail’s inflorescence is a dense panicle and is 2.5 to 7.5 cm (1 to 3 inches) in length, and usually about 6 to 13 mm (1/4 to 1/2 inch) wide. This grass produces a medium size seed, which retains a hairy pubescence making it light and/or fluffy. Once established, Meadow Foxtail has high seedling vigor. Meadow Foxtail produces approximately 406,000 seeds per pound of seed. Uses Livestock: Meadow Foxtail can be used for pasture, hay, or silage. It is highly palatable to all classes of livestock, such as cattle, sheep, and horses. Meadow Foxtail starts its growth in early spring and provides livestock with adequate forage.

"explain of side effects, with simultaneous administration of quinidine, digoxin, calcium, saluretics, laxatives","laxatives for longer than the recommended short-term application may increase intestinal sluggishness (28). The use of stimulant laxatives for more than 2 weeks requires medical supervision. Chronic use may lead to pseudomelanosis coli (harmless) and to an aggrava- tion of constipation with dependence and possible need for increased dosages. Chronic abuse with diarrhoea and consequent ﬂuid and electrolyte losses (mainly hypokalaemia) may cause albuminuria and haematuria, and it may result in cardiac and neuromuscular dysfunction, the latter particularly in case of concomitant use of cardiac glycosides (digoxin), diuretics, corticosteroids, or liquorice root (see below, Precautions). 236 Rhizoma Rhei Precautions General Laxatives containing anthraquinone glycosides should not be used for periods longer than 1–2 weeks continually, owing to the danger of electrolyte imbal- ance (29). Drug interactions Decreased intestinal transit time may reduce absorption of orally administered drugs (30). Electrolyte imbalances such as increased loss of potassium may potentiate the effects of cardiotonic glycosides (digitalis, strophanthus).

Currently available internal combustion engines suffer from several disadvantages. They are inefficient in their utilisation of the energy present in their fuels. The fuel itself is generally a petroleum derivative with an ever-increasing price and sometimes limited availability. The burning of such fuel normally results in pollutants which are emitted into the atmosphere. These engines require oxygen and are particularly unsuitable in environments such as underwater or outer space in which gaseous oxygen is relatively unavailable. Present internal combustion engines are furthermore relatively complex with a great number of moving parts. Larger units such as fossil-fuel electric power plants escape some of the disadvantages of the present internal combustion engine those of pollution price of fuel and availability of fuel.

Exposed bags may burn, spill their contents, and become susceptible to the blast wave. Steel Steel is the most commonly used material for protection against direct and indirect fire fragmentation. Steel is also more likely to deform a projectile as it penetrates, and is much less likely to span than concrete.

Methods of Nature Cure The nature cure system aims at the readjustment of the human system from abnormal to normal conditions and functions, and adopts methods of cure which are in conformity with the constructive principles of nature. Such methods remove from the system the accumulation of toxic matter and poisons without in any way injuring the vital organs of the body. They also stimulate the organs of elimination and purification to better functioning. To cure disease, the first and foremost requirement is to regulate the diet. To get rid of accumulated toxins and restore the equilibrium of the system, it is desirable to completely exclude acid-forming foods, including proteins, starches and fats, for a week or more and to confine the diet to fresh fruits which will disinfect the stomach and alimentary canal. If the body is overloaded with morbid matter, as in acute disease, a complete fast for a few days may be necessary for the elimination of toxins.

explain on the same bough; it is a full bearer,"electromagnetic, electrostatic and radiesthesic acceleration)"". In trying to explain aether, it might be thought of as an all-pervasive liquid, occupying all of space. This liquid concept is useful because a liquid can not be compressed but can only transfer the energy attempting to compress it from one location to another. This is how the brakes of a vehicle work. The driver presses the brake pedal when he wants to slow down or stop. The plunger of the brake pedal attempts to compress the liquid in the master cylinder. The master cylinder is connected to each wheel by metal tubes full of liquid. When pressure is put on the master cylinder by the driver it is transmitted to each of the four wheel cylinders full of the same fluid which transmits the force, moving the brake mechanism, slowing the wheels of the vehicle. In a similar way, the aether serves to transmit energy through this ""non-compressible"" quality. In a primary electric coil and secondary electric coil, for instance, induction in the secondary does not take place directly from the primary as",0,-9.226057052612305,9.843093721428886e-05,0

Large transfer switches switch the power to a house or group of buildings and are wired between the meter socket and breaker (or fuse) panel. These cost $300-$600 depending on capacity. They are costly to install as well. Automatic transfer switches will start the generator and switch the load to it without intervention. Some standby systems have these built in. One catalog I have lists a 200A model as costing almost $2,000. Telephone companies, hospitals, radio and TV stations, and the like use larger versions of these. Transfer switches are wired with a large, flexible cord and plug for use with portable generators. The cord and plug are not normally included with the transfer switch and must be purchased separately. Welding supply companies are a good, inexpensive source for the heavy gauge wire required.

explain bales can be subject to free grazing by moose if not protected,"Overgrazing during drought greatly increases the risk of grass mortality. To reduce this risk, it is recommended that grazing management be conservative during both the drought period and the growing season following drought. This means grazing fewer animals for shorter periods of time, leaving more leaves and stems for plant survival and regrowth. 10 Grazing Management Guidelines A definition of grazing management is grazing at the right time and intensity to maintain sufficient plant cover, protect the soil, and maintain or improve the quantity and quality of forage. To take care of the pasture that you have or are reestablishing, proper grazing management techniques must be followed. These techniques require discipline and an understanding of the forages and animals that you have. They require “being on the ground” and aware of how your forage and animals are performing. Grazing management is both an art and a science. A major consequence of poor grazing management is that desirable forages will die and be replaced by undesirable weeds like Russian thistle, downy brome, kochia, and bindweed.

Any tests should be done with extreme caution, taking every precaution against injury or damage should the mixture explode. It should be stressed that hydroxy gas is highly explosive, with a flame front speed far too fast to be contained by conventional commercial flashback arrestors.

The added oil helps make sure he gets enough energy (calories) by the time his belly is full. CAUTION: The time when a child is most likely to become malnourished is from 6 months to 2 years old. This is because breast milk by itself does not provide enough energy for a baby after 6 months of age. Other foods are needed, but often the foods given do not contain enough energy either. If the mother also stops breastfeeding, the child is even more likely to become malnourished.

explain to wear over your clothing while working outdoors,"When dressing for any hunt, make sure to take into consideration what you may be doing. Dressing in layers will allow you to regulate your body temperature more efficiently. The idea is to wear only the layers that you need to stay warm and dry at the time, but have the option to take a layer off or put another layer on if conditions change. In cool weather, for instance, you’ll probably want to wear fewer layers to hike up a steep incline, but will want to put another layer or two on once you are setup at your hunting spot and likely to be sitting for a while. A tough pair of jeans or brush pants also may be a good idea to help protect your legs when working in brush.

Death is rare, occurring mainly in children and adults with high blood pressure or illnesses. Treat scorpion stings as you would a black widow bite. Snakebites The chance of a snakebite in a survival situation is rather small, if you are familiar with the various types of snakes and their habitats. However, it could happen and you should know how to treat a snakebite. Deaths from snakebites are rare. More than one-half of the snakebite victims have little or no poisoning, and only about one-quarter develop serious systemic poisoning. However, the chance of a snakebite in a survival situation can affect morale, and failure to take preventive measures or failure to treat a snakebite properly can result in needless tragedy.

This is common and often happens before the woman even knows she is pregnant. It is usually difficult to know why a miscarriage happens, but some causes of miscarriage are preventable. Malaria, sexually transmitted infections, injury, violence, and stress can all cause a pregnancy to end. Sometimes miscarriages happen because a woman has been near poisons or toxic chemicals. For example, women who work on farms often breathe or handle pesticides which can cause miscarriage. These women have more miscarriages than other women.

Each cable needs to have it’s own space keeping it clear of all the other cables and having a pulley mounted at any points where there is a change of direction. To make maintenance easier, it is also suggested that these protecting pipes are not fixed in position but are themselves on a pulley system so that they can be hauled ashore: The buoys are also linked together loosely on top with a securing cord so that they always stay in a compact group, though there is little chance of any great sideways movement as the tension in the buoy cables is high.",0,-8.17459487915039,0.0002816412306856364,0

Specifically, this back EMF energy with its nett force is deliberately applied in the motor of the present invention to overcome and even reverse the conventional drag-back (the back EMF). Hence, less energy needs to be taken from the rotor and flywheel to overcome the reduced back EMF, and in the ideal case, none is required since the back EMF has been overpowered and converted to forward EMF by the back EMF energy and force. In the motor, the conventional drag section of the magnetics becomes a forward-EMF section and now adds energy to the rotor/flywheel instead of reducing it. The important feature is that the operator only pays for the small amount of energy necessary to trigger the back EMF from the primary battery, and does not have to furnish the much larger back EMF energy itself.

"explain virus strain occurs during the regular influenza season, the patient s healthcare contacts","virus strain occurs during the regular influenza season, the patient’s healthcare contacts (who may also care for persons with seasonal influenza) should be vaccinated against seasonal influenza to reduce the possible risk of co-infection and reassortment of seasonal and novel strains. Use of antivirals for containment of disease clusters In special circumstances, state and local health departments could consider “targeted antiviral prophylaxis” as a community- based measure for containing small clusters of infection with novel strains of influenza (see Supplement 8). This measure could be implemented in small, well-defined settings such as the initial introduction of a virus with pandemic potential into a small community or a military base. However, once a pandemic is underway, such a strategy would not represent an efficient use of limited antiviral supplies. Because targeted antiviral prophylaxis would require rapid delivery and administration of substantial stocks of antiviral drugs, its feasibility should be evaluated in light of antiviral drug supply and interim recommendations on antiviral drug use during a pandemic (see S7-III.B). Targeted antiviral prophylaxis would involve investigation of disease clusters, administration of antiviral",0,-4.942236423492432,0.007088016718626022,0

Another aspect of this is that self-sufficient, responsible families were often regarded almost with suspicion by rescuers. The latter seemed to believe that if you’d come through the disaster better than your neighbors, it could only have been because you stole what you needed, or somehow gained some sort of unfair advantage over the “average victims” in your area. I’m at a loss to explain this, but it’s probably worth keeping in mind. There seems to be a cumulative psychological effect upon survivors. This is clear even - or perhaps particularly - in those who were prepared for a disaster. During and immediately after the disaster, these folks were at their best, dealing with damage, setting up alternative accommodation, light, food sources, etc. However, after a few days in the heat and debris (perhaps worst of all being the smell of dead bodies nearby), many found their ability to remain positive and “upbeat” being strained to the limit.

There are many proven technologies ranging from inexpensive gasoline generators, to whole-house solar power systems, to more exotic alternatives such as windmills and fuel cells. Not only does generating your own power protect you from terrorist attacks, it also protects you from disruption due to natural disasters and infrastructure failures. Millions of people throughout the world now generate their own power, and so can you. One word of caution: Despite technological advances, generating your own power in most parts of the country is still more expensive than buying it from the utilities – at least in terms of “up-front” cost of equipment. Also, the price of popular fuels – such as propane – will go sky-high in a crisis. Therefore, it is highly beneficial for you to do anything you can to slash your energy consumption – for instance, substituting fluorescent lights for incandescent, and buying new, energy-efficient appliances, such as a refrigerators and air conditioners with the “Energy Star” label.

It could be the last walk you will ever attempt. Before attempting to walk out, ask yourself the following questions: • Will the weather, snow conditions, wind and visibility permit the walk? (Usually not) • Will the hours of remaining daylight permit you to reach help? (Probably not) • Is the clothing",0,-3.152848720550537,0.04097918048501015,0

Transverse bracing (Figure 10-8) provides stability at right angles to the centerline. It is sometimes called sway or lateral bracing. Diaphragms are braces between stringers to prevent them from deflecting laterally (buckling) under load. In spacing these diaphragms, the ratio of distance between diaphragms to the width of the top of stringer (L/b ratio) should not exceed 30 for timber. L = distance between diaphragms b = width of top of stringer Example. If the stringer is 6 inches wide— L = 30 L = 180 inches (15 feet) In this example, diaphragms should be used every 15 feet between stringers 6 inches wide.

During peacetime, terrain analysts build extensive data bases for each potential area of operations. They provide a base for all intelligence operations, tactical decisions, and tactical operations. They also sup- port the planning and execution of most other battlefield functions. Because terrain features continually undergo change on the earth’s surface, data bases must be continuously revised and updated. PURPOSE This field manual prescribes basic doctrine and is intended to serve as a primary source of the most current available information on terrain analysis procedures for all personnel who plan, supervise, and conduct terrain analysis. The manual discusses the impact of the terrain and the weather on operations. USER INFORMATION The proponent of this publication is the US Army Engineer School.

Clothing, as well as the body, must stay clean and dry. If clothing gets wet—not just damp—take it off and change into something dry. One won’t be able to stay warm in wet clothing. Keeping clothes clean will lessen the chances of exposure to rashes and infections. Change clothes, especially underclothing and socks, regularly. CONFIRMATION OF TEACHING POINT 1 QUESTIONS Q1.

PEAS, GREEN OR YELLOW: More often found as split peas though whole peas can some- times be had. The yellow variety has become somewhat uncommon but has a milder flavor than the green types which well lends them to blending inconspicuously into other foods. Probably best known in split pea soup, particularly with a smoky chunk of ham added. They are also used in Indian cuisine, especially dals. Whole peas need soaking, but split peas can be cooked as is. Split peas and pea meal makes an excellent thickener for soups and stews. Because splitting damages the pea, this more processed form does not keep for as long as whole peas unless given special packaging. PINK AND RED BEANS: Related to the kidney bean these are smaller in size but similar in flavor. The pink bean has a more delicate flavor than the red.

A randomized controlled trial of 165 patients utilized a 400 mg single-bolus dose of berberine sulfate for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-induced diarrhoea and either 400 mg as a single oral dose or 1200 mg of berberine sulfate (400 mg every 8 hours) for the treatment of cholera (33).

Flash Burns: Flash burns result from intense heat for a brief time caused by explosions of natural gas, propane, gasoline, and other flammable liquids. Contact Burns: These burns usually result from direct contact of hot metals, plastics, glass, or coals. Contact burns are usually limited in size, but are deep wounds. With the increase of wood stove usage, this type of burn injury is on the rise in children. Contact burns, dealing with an unconscious patient or involving molten materials, are usually fourth degree. The most common contact burn in the wilderness is from hot coals. Electrical Burns: Electrical burns are actually thermal burns from very high-intensity heat. When electricity encounters resistance from the body it turns into heat. Severity of the burn depends on the portion of the body affected relative to the amperage. The smaller the body part, the more intense the heat is, and the part is less able to dissipate the heat.

Radiological Emergency Preparedness Plans/Procedures REP plans/procedures describe what a given jurisdiction will do in case of a radiological emergency. The plans/procedures are part of an organization’s emergency operations plan for all types of hazards and may be documented as a hazard-specific appendix to the emergency operations plan, as recommended in FEMA’s CPG 101. Most of the plan/procedure is devoted to describing the emergency response activities and functions that must be performed and designating the OROs that perform them. Most plans/procedures describe emergency functions at three levels of detail: A “concept of operations” section gives an overview of the entire jurisdiction’s response organization and briefly describes the main functions of each agency. Agency-specific chapters give more detailed descriptions of agency roles and responsibilities. Step-by-step procedures outline the tasks to be performed by particular response staff, and are incorporated into the plan or attached as separate volumes. For example, the local health department may have a specific procedure for its EOC representative, outlining which health department resources to activate at particular ECLs.

Even when your water supply is low, sipping water constantly will keep your body cooler and reduce water loss through sweating. Conserve your fluids by reducing activity during the heat of day. Do not ration your water! If you try to ration water, you stand a good chance of becoming a heat casualty. HEAT CASUALTIES 13-35. Your chances of becoming a heat casualty as a survivor are great, due to injury, stress, and lack of critical items of equipment. Following are the major types of heat casualties and their treatment when little water and no medical help are available. The loss of salt due to excessive sweating causes heat cramps. Symptoms are moderate to severe muscle cramps in legs, arms, or abdomen. These symptoms may start as a mild muscular discomfort. You should now stop all activity, get in the shade, and drink water.

There is, however, the also remote possibility it may have been infected with fungi that would make it unsafe for eating. One of these fungal infections of grain is called “ergot”. This fungal disease affects the flowering parts of some members of the grass family, mostly confined to rye. Consuming the fungus causes a nervous disorder known as St. When eaten in large quantities the ergot alkaloids may cause constriction of the blood vessels, particularly in the extremities. The effects of ergot poisoning are cumulative and lead to numbness of the limbs and other, frequently serious, symptoms. The fungus bodies are hard, spur like, purple-black struc- tures that replace the kernel in the grain head. The ergot bodies can vary in size from the length of the kernel to as much as several times as long. They don’t crush as easily as smut bodies of other funguses.

The water freezes and falls lower and lower, leaving convenient shelves of ice (Fig. 57) for one's larder.

"explain rolling outward motion, peel the flaps apart to approxi mately ont third the way","the shape of the workpiece is created by a rolling motion between the die profile and the involute flank of the gear tooth. In this process the mechanised feed motion makes the rolling dies penetrate the workpiece, with direction and speed adjusted depending upon the diameter, causing the material to flow into the profile space on the die. This process continues until the required gear tooth parame- ters are obtained (root circle and addendum circle diameter). When the constructional setup of the rolling tooling is planned mathematically, the constantly changing kinematic rolling interrelations from the penetration of the die teeth into the work- piece must be taken into account. The process means that the material flow is asymmetric, causing the flanks of the teeth to devi- ate in shape from that intended; this can be counteracted by controlled reversing (change of rolling die direction during the cylindrical rolling process) which swaps the flank coast and drive sides. The depression which forms along the top land of the tooth when gear teeth are rolled has no effect on the gear tooth",0,-9.024450302124023,0.00012041448644595221,0

explain the bait trig ger may have a prong on to hold the,"A natural trigger finger placement allows the trigger to be moved straight to the rear while maintaining sight alignment. If the finger presses the trigger to the side, it can cause an error in sight alignment and shot placement. Each Marine must experiment with finger place- ment in order to determine effective placement on the trigger. Once established, effective trigger finger placement allows the trigger to be consis- tently moved straight to the rear while maintain- ing sight alignment. Types of Trigger Control Uninterrupted Trigger Control During uninterrupted trigger control, the Marine applies a steady, unchanging pressure to the trig- ger until the shot is fired.

Richard Harry Graves was born 17th July, 1898 (some sources list year of birth as 1897 or 1899) in Co. He died 3 days before I was born, on 3rd February, 1971 in Sydney, Australia. He is credited with the authorship of several books and is formerly a Commanding Officer of the Australian Jungle Survival & Rescue Detachment on active service with the U.S.A.A.F. 'The 10 Bushcraft Books' are the seminal texts on bushcraft and this on-line edition (based on the first edition of the book set) has been released to share this unique source of knowledge. Originally written as wartime information for conducting rescue missions, the notes were later revised and prepared for a School of Bushcraft which was conducted for nearly 20 years. Almost all the quirks of the original text have been retained (illustrations by the author, inconsistent word usage, strange",1,9.316755294799805,0.9999101161956787,1

Some medicines, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, make ulcers worse. Persons with signs of heartburn or acid indigestion should avoid them—use acetaminophen instead of aspirin. Cortico-steroids also make ulcers worse (see p. It is important to treat an ulcer early. Otherwise it may lead to dangerous bleeding or peritonitis. Ulcers sometimes get better if the person is careful with what he eats and drinks. Anger, tension, and nervousness increase acid in the stomach. Learning to relax and keep calm will help.

In general, the toxicity proﬁles associated with antisense agents are transient and mild to moderate.

SHORTCOMINGS OF ANTISENSE THERAPEUTICS 323 which bind non-speciﬁcally to plasma proteins (Chan et al., 2006). By far, the most signiﬁcant challenge that each of the antisense agents face is their systemic delivery to targeted cells. For antisense molecules to elicit their effect, they must be able to efﬁciently enter cells to reach their target mRNA. However, internalization of oligonucleotides is usually limited owing to their inherent negative charge, making it difﬁcult for them to efﬁciently cross the hydropho- bic cell membrane. As a result, considerable efforts have been made in designing efﬁcient in vivo and in vitro delivery vehicles, with many antisense technology companies focusing intensely on solving this problem.

S O I L p H Good garden soil that is loose, friable, and rich in organic matter is the foundation for successful gardening. Take the necessary time to get it right before planting. Soil acidity and alkalinity are measured in terms of pH on a scale from 1 to 14. A 7 on the scale indicates the soil is neutral in pH. Lower than 7, the soil is increasingly acidic; higher than 7, it is increasingly alkaline. Soil pH is important because it aﬀ ects the availability of nutrients necessary for plant growth. Most nutrients are most soluble at a pH between 6 and 7. That is why most plants grow best in “slightly acidic soil.” Iron chlorosis, a yellowing of foliage between the leaf veins caused by lack of available iron in the soil, can be a problem in alkaline soils. Most plants tolerate a range of soil pH, but some survive only within a narrow window. It is important to know",0,-8.765913009643555,0.00015593536954838783,0

Each combatant soldier should be armed with the rifle. If there are not enough rifles, each squad should have two or three. Shotguns, lances, and big swords can also be furnished. The dis- tribution of rifles does not have to be equalized in platoons. As different missions to give one platoon more rifles are assigned to platoons, it may be necessary than the others.

explain a few days had passed since our conversation with the frenchman about,"Selling cars seemed pretty safe, he told me. As silly as that conversation sounded, it had taken us out of this place. Being in his own head all day every day was not something that any of us was looking forward to, but it seemed we had no choice. A few minutes after the Frenchman left, the other guards started to set up our new arrangements. Tom remained in the hooch and Keith and I were once again back in a coleta underneath nylon tent tops hung The Transition 105 over wooden frameworks. Keith was at one end of the clearing, and I was at the other.

"explain flat area to a ridge, then use terrain association for the rest","align the turret on the azimuth you wish to travel, then switch the turret stabilization system on. The gun tube remains pointed at your destination no matter which way you turn the vehicle. This technique has been proven; it works. It is not harmful to the stabilization system. It is subject to stabilization drift, so use it for no more than 5,000 meters before resetting. NOTE: If you have to take the turret off-line to engage a target, you will have to start all over, re-do the entire process. COMBINATION NAVIGATION Some mounted situations may call for you to combine and use both methods. Just remember the characteristics of each. Terrain association is fast, is error-tolerant, and is best under most circumstances. It can be used day or night if you are proficient in it. Dead reckoning is very accurate if you do everything correctly. You must be very precise. It is also slow, but it works on very flat terrain. You frequently will combine both.

If properly done, they should allow the hoop to pass freely from one end of the box to the other, and settle easily between the partitions. If this hinge should prove too complicated for our young readers, they may resort to another method, which, although not so durable, will answer very well. In this case the wire will only need to reach to the exact middle of the long sides. No surplus being necessary, a length of twenty-six inches will be exactly right.

Referring to Fig.23 (titled ""Resistance (Ohms) Per Pressure Increase""), the resistance was calculated from Test Run No. 1 (0.82 ohms) to Test Run No. These data indicate that the losses due to resistance in the electrolysis system at high pressures are negligible.

This diagram was produced by Paul Potter in his attempt to back-engineer the device from the information available: Paul Baumann’s device may operate by creating a series of very short, high-power electrical discharges in the conductors passing through the centre of the two cylinders. These cylinders are effectively the same as Ed Gray’s discharge tube, both having metal shells around the pulsed conductor. The shells pick up the waves of Radiant Energy created by the electrical pulses and feed that energy to the workload. It would be easy to assume that Paul used a motor-driven version of a Wimshurst machine to pick up ‘static’ energy to 13 - 1 create the sparks, as shown below but reports from the commune state that the static electricity discs rotate on their own with no motor being use to drive them.

When exposed to air, fatty acids become rancid, which means that they combine with oxygen to form hydroperoxides, natural substances that taste bad, smell bad, and may destroy the vitamin E in the oil. The higher the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the oil, the more quickly it will turn rancid.

The young look like the adult and increase in size as the summer progresses. Eggs are laid in the ground in fall in protected locations. Prevention & Control: Hand-pick slugs in the evening or early morning. Trap slugs by placing boards around plants to act as collection sites. Collect and dispose of the slugs that are escaping the midday sun on the undersides of the boards. Sink shallow pans of beer into the ground so the lip is at ground level to attract slugs. Empty the pans at least twice a week. Place a 5-inch grit barrier such as diatomaceous earth, sharp or builder’s sand, ground gritty nut hulls, or ground eggshells around plants. The sharp edges lacerate the bodies of slugs, causing them to dehydrate and die. Copper strips or copper wire placed around the base of plants or pots makes an eﬀ ective barrier or deterrent. 231 T A K I N G C A R",0,-8.135771751403809,0.0002927871828433126,0

The usual mode of catching the creature is to set the trap size No. 3 at the mouth of its burrow, carefully covering it with loose earth and securing it by a chain to a stake. Any of the methods used in trapping the fox will also be found to work admirably. The dead-fall or garrote will also do good service. Bait with a rat, mouse, or with whatever else the animal is especially fond, and scent with Oil of Anise or Musk.

The Moon orbits around the Earth which requires a continuous acceleration inwards towards the Earth and this is said to be caused by the attraction of gravity pulling the two bodies of matter together. Well, yes the Moon does orbit the Earth but not because of “the force of gravity”. The reason why “the force of gravity” is so tiny compared to electromagnetism is because there is no such force at all. Yes, indeed, all of the observed phenomena which are supposed to be gravitational, do exist exactly as seen, but I suggest that there is no such thing as “the force of gravity” and the Unified Field Theory is not needed. Let me explain: The Zero-Point Energy field exists everywhere in the universe and it flows in every direction equally. It acts like a flow of particles thousands of times more tiny than electrons, and so, it flows through matter.

explain dosage of the trunk bark extract was 75 200 mg daily for at,"Introduction Role of the WHO monographs on selected medicinal plants The ﬁrst volume of the WHO monographs on selected medicinal plants, containing 28 monographs, was published in 1999. It is gratifying that the importance of the monographs is already being recognized. For example, the European Com- mission has recommended volume 1 to its Member States as an authoritative reference on the quality, safety and efﬁcacy of medicinal plants. The Canadian Government has also made a similar recommendation. Furthermore, as hoped, some of WHO’s Member States, such as Benin, Mexico, South Africa and Viet Nam, have developed their own monographs based on the format of the WHO monographs. The monographs are not only a valuable scientiﬁc reference for health authorities, scientists and pharmacists, but will also be of interest to the general public. There can be little doubt that the WHO monographs will continue to play an important role in promoting the proper use of medicinal plants through- out the world.

"explain of the package, and insert the iud into the womb","_________________ price: _________________ fee for putting it in: _____________________________ An IUD must be inserted and removed by a trained health worker. The most common side effect is heavier, longer and more painful monthly bleeding, but this usually stops after the first 3 months. Occasionally an IUD will slip out of place. If this happens, it will not be effective in preventing pregnancy, so it is important for a woman with an IUD to learn to check it to make sure it is still in place. Most IUDs have 2 thread-like strings attached which hang down into the vagina. The woman should check the strings after each monthly bleeding to make sure the IUD is in place. To check the strings, she should wash her hands well and then reach as far as she can into the vagina with two fingers and feel for the IUD strings. Do not pull on the strings. If she cannot feel the strings, or if she can feel the hard part of the IUD, she needs to use a condom or another method of family",0,-7.983463764190674,0.0003409397613722831,0
"explain and installation, when adding rock salt, be very sparing indeed","known, however, that in the more permeable belts surround ing the clay cores a very alkaline soil may be underlain by ground water that is not excessively mineralized and that may indeed be very pure. Grasses that flourish on alkaline soil, such as salt grass and alkali sacaton, apparently have considerable transpira tion. This fact leads to the suggestion that they may obtain most of their water supply not from the physiologically dry soil but from the relatively pure water of the zone of saturation. The leaves of tamarix are known to have glands for excreting salt,60 and the leaves of salt grass apparently have a similar adaptation. This may enable the salt grass to function as a true salt-resistant plant at times when only highly concentrated soil water is available but to reduce its sap concentration and to transpire more freely when there is an adequate supply of better water.

explain to several thousand meters above sea level,"Land navigation will be extremely difficult as there may be very few landmarks. Cover and concealment may be very limited; therefore, the threat of exposure to the enemy remains constant. Mountain Deserts Scattered ranges or areas of barren hills or mountains separated by dry, flat basins characterize mountain deserts. High ground may rise gradually or abruptly from flat areas to several thousand meters above sea level. Most of the infrequent rainfall occurs on high ground and runs off rapidly in the form of flash floods. These floodwaters erode deep gullies and ravines and deposit sand and gravel around the edges of the basins. Water rapidly evaporates, leaving the land as barren as before, although there may be short-lived vegetation. If enough water enters the basin to compensate for the rate of evaporation, shallow lakes may develop, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah, or the Dead Sea. Most of these lakes have a high salt content.

All magazines should face down with the bullets facing forward and to the center of the body. When possible, count the number of rounds fired. However, it is possible to lose count in close combat. If this happens, there is a distinct difference in recoil of the pistol when the last round has been fired. Change magazines when two rounds may be left--one in the magazine and one in the chamber.

Although going may be heavy, the high permafrost level ensures that vehicles normally are not bogged in the mud or gravel. During the spring period, vehicles should carry a reduced load. Traffic should be permitted only at night when temperatures are below freezing. This will allow engineers time to perform necessary maintenance without interruption during the day.

Progressive loss of tensile strength and eventual absorption of MONOCRYL sutures occurs by means of hydrolysis. Absorption begins as a loss of tensile strength followed by a loss of mass.

You need to understand that rescue missions basically help two very different groups of people: People who are in “The Program,” and “The Over- nighters.” A person in “The Program” is typically referred to the rescue mission by court order. They’re forced to be there. Suppose a guy is arrested and convicted of possession of drugs.

explain occasionally the reaction is more severe and evolves to an anaphylactic reaction,"in the ground like bumblebees. The main danger from 11-3 FM 3-05.70 bees is the barbed stinger located on their abdomens. When a bee stings you, it rips its stinger out of its abdomen along with the venom sac, and dies. Except for killer bees, most bees tend to be more docile than wasps, hornets, and yellow jackets, which have smooth stingers and are capable of repeated attacks. Avoidance is the best tactic for self-protection. Watch out for flowers or fruit where bees may be feeding. Be careful of meat- eating yellow jackets when cleaning fish or game. The average person has a relatively minor and temporary reaction to bee stings and recovers in a couple of hours when the pain and headache go away. Those who are allergic to bee venom have severe reactions including anaphylactic shock, coma, and death. If antihistamine medicine is not available and you cannot find a substitute, an allergy sufferer in a survival situation is in grave danger.

State health authorities should consider promoting the establishment of local pandemic influenza task forces that will ensure community readiness to provide emergency support to healthcare facilities on a city-wide or regional basis. Depending on the state the task forces may be coordinated by municipal or tribal health departments or by regional public health offices. Task force activities should be integrated with state-wide planning efforts and should reflect common goals and principles for preparedness and response.

explain to several thousand meters above sea level,"metals, salts, and most other chemicals. Before treating, let any suspended particles settle to the bottom, or strain them through layers of paper towel or clean cloth. Boiling Boiling is one guaranteed way to purify water of all pathogens. At sea level, water simply brought to a boil is safe, but add one minute to the boiling time for every additional thousand meters (3300 feet) in altitude. (It’s something of a myth that water has to be boiled for five or ten minutes to be safe, this is just a waste of fuel.) In a large pot or kettle, bring water to a rolling boil for 1 full minute, keeping in mind that some water will evaporate. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back and forth between two clean containers. This will also improve the taste of stored water. You can also add a chunk of charcoal or some pine needles, during boiling, and remove them before drinking, to improve taste. Straining Straining turbid",0,-8.63917350769043,0.00017700182797852904,0

explain monofilament prolene sutures also provide all the advantages of steel sutures: strength,"the suture knot is snug. Multifilament sutures are generally easier to handle and to tie than monofilament sutures, however, all the synthetic materials require a specific knotting technique. With multifilament sutures, the nature of the material and the braided or twisted construction provide a high coefficient of friction and the knots remain as they are laid down. In monofilament sutures, on the other hand, the coefficient of friction is relatively low, resulting in a greater tendency for the knot to loosen after it has been tied. In addition, monofilament synthetic polymeric materials possess the property of memory. Memory is the tendency not to lie flat, but to return to a given shape set by the material's extrusion process or the suture's packaging. The RELAY* suture delivery system delivers sutures with minimal package memory due to its unique package design. Suture knots must be properly placed to be secure. Speed in tying knots may result in less than perfect placement of the strands. In addition to variables inherent in the suture materials, considerable variation can be found between knots tied by",0,-7.203336238861084,0.0007435459410771728,0

explain reported that there were no elk towards point adams,"motor exceeded the input power by a large margin (800%). The diagram of his motor most frequently shown to explain the basic operation is this one: with all of the rotor magnets presenting a North pole to the electromagnets. The motor efficiency is high because the permanent magnets of the rotor are attracted to the (laminated) soft iron cores of the electromagnets. Then, the electromagnet coils are pulsed with just enough power to cancel the attraction as the rotor magnets move away again. It is important to understand this. While it is an option to push a large amount of electrical power into the electromagnet coils and generate a very large repulsion push as soon as it is strategic to do so, that method of operation does not produce the highest efficiency. Phil Wood received instruction direct from Robert Adams, when Phil was building his replication of the Adams motor. He stresses that there are a number of important practical details which need to be considered when building a motor of this type. Phil states that the motor operation is",0,-8.823490142822266,0.00014721193292643875,0

For the mink, a bird's head, or the head of a fowl, is the customary bait; and the skunk may usually be taken with sweet apples, meats, or some portion of a dead fowl. In the case of the fox, which we have mentioned, the setting of the trap was somewhat varied; and in case our readers might desire to try a similar experiment, we will devote a few lines to a description of it. In this instance, the flat stick which supported the log was not more than eight inches in length; and instead of the bait-stick, a slight framework of slender branches was substituted. This frame or lattice-work was just large enough to fill the opening of the pen, and its upper end supported the flat stick. The duck was fastened to the back part of the pen, which was also closed over the top. The quacking of the fowl attracted the fox; and as he thrust his head through the lattice to reach his prey, the frame was thrown out",0,-8.890920639038086,0.00013761395530309528,0
"explain it should have a minimum of 9 transistors and 100 milliwatts, although","which in turn generates a current that activates the transistors 19a and 19b. The activated transistors 19a and 19b discharge the capacitors in the bank 20 into the battery 22 until the voltage across the bank 20 is or is approximately equal to the voltage across the battery 22 plus the lowest threshold voltage of the transistors 19a and 19b. Alternatively, the circuit 13 can deactivate the isolator 15 at a time before the bank 20 reaches this level of discharge. Because the resistances of the transistors 19a and 19b, the resistors 44a and 44b, and the battery 22 are relatively low, the capacitors in the bank 20 discharge rather rapidly, thus delivering a pulse of current to charge the battery 22. For example, where the pulse-charger includes components having the values listed above, the bank 20 delivers a pulse of current having a duration of about 100 ms and a peak of about 250 A.

Copyright 2011 by suburbanprep http://survival5x5.com/?author=1 EMERGENCY SHELTER In survival as in all aspects of life, it is easier to be organized if we prioritize. The priorities, in order, are shelter, water, heat, food, signal, and utility. You can live 4-6 weeks without food; 3-5 days without water; but hypothermia will kill you in 30 minutes. Therefore shelter is the first priority! Shelter may be defined as anything that protects the human element from nature’s elements. I will not discuss clothing here, other than to say that a good coat can’t be beat, and it is easier to survive in the summer with winter clothes than in the winter with summer clothes.

explain damage control laparotomy,"made in most manufactured motors as they can easily be converted into generators. Just scavenge the collapses of the armature and field coil, control it with an external circuit, and you have a stand-alone over-unity electrical generator. There is a stationary ""motionless electromagnetic generator” design, based on the Alexander patent that has been built experimentally. No far out zero-point vacuum explanations are needed to explain its operation. The best form of any such generator would have no moving parts. Looking at any common transformer, and considering how it works, supplies the answer. In any kind of transformer, electricity is transferred between the two coils by the magnetic field. When a coil is initially powered up or switched off, that coil creates a magnetic field which causes a rush of electricity, usually called a 'voltage spike'. In conventional electronics, this voltage spike is suppressed to protect the other circuit components from damage. In collapsing field technology (CFT), that voltage spike is harnessed, rather than being suppressed.

explain even with a huge law enforcement presence,"reference to such a list in the ORO’s plans/procedures. During a HAB incident, there are special considerations to consider. The licensee notification pathways (to initial warning points and local law enforcement agencies) serve different and distinct purposes and may not occur in parallel based on progression of the HAB incident.

ORO plans/procedures address the challenge of ensuring that all appropriate parties who need to take immediate action are included when multiple-pathway notification occurs. If local law enforcement agencies receive the initial notification or the licensee’s initial response to a HAB incident at the NPP is in direct interaction with local law enforcement, this could result in unintentional delays or bypassed notifications to emergency management agencies and state/local warning points, especially if the incident is resolved before any assistance is requested beyond local law enforcement agencies. To prepare for HAB incidents, OROs ensure that plans/procedures include a notification process that works in all directions (not just from the licensee to NRC and OROs).

An essential component of combat power, it was especially critical in executing noncontiguous and decentralized operations in the compartmented terrain of Los Angeles. As important, however, was the clear understanding that Army forces were to support civilian law enforcement— and not the other way around. The 40th Infantry Division aligned its area of operations with local law enforcement boundaries and relied heavily on police recommendations for the level at which Soldiers be armed (the need for magazines to be locked in weapons or rounds chambered). One incident emphasized the need for coordination of command and control measures with civilian agencies even at the lowest tactical levels. To civilian law enforcement and Army forces, the command “Cover me” was interpreted the same: be prepared to shoot if necessary. However, when a police officer responding to a complaint of domestic abuse issued that command to an accompanying squad of Marines, they responded by immediately providing a supporting base of fire that narrowly missed some children at home.

This tree is common throughout southeastern Europe and across temperate Asia. Beech relatives are also found in Chile, New Guinea, and New Zealand. Edible Parts: The mature beechnuts readily fall out of the husklike seedpods. You can eat these dark brown triangular nuts by breaking the thin shell with your fingernail and removing the white, sweet kernel inside. Beechnuts are one of the most delicious of all wild nuts. They are a most useful survival food because of the kernel's high oil content. You can also use the beechnuts as a coffee substitute. Roast them so that the kernel becomes golden brown and quite hard. Then pulverize the kernel and, after boiling or steeping in hot water, you have a passable coffee substitute.

"explain activation devices depending on the type of flashlight, there are several ways","Lighting Techniques 1. Explain and demonstrate the steps in starting a successful fire. Stages in Fire Lighting There are four basic stages in fire lighting: 1. Ignition - The most common way to start a fire is with matches. Others are the flint and steel and the bow drill. Establishment - This stage involves using the most effective method to light the required type of fire with the fuel available. Fine and coarse kindlings are ignited, which in turn ignite sufficient fuel of the right quality so the fire will continue to burn even in wind or rain. Establishment is a critical aspect of firelighting under adverse conditions as there are often many problems to overcome. Application - Fire arrangements vary depending on the application and fuel available. There are fires for cooking, warming, drying, repelling insects, signal fires and so on. Maintenance and Moderation - A fire can be made to burn at a desired output with a minimum of smoke. Knowledgeable maintenance will allow you long periods between adjustments or stokings.

Convoy commanders are responsible for the convoy's CCD discipline. Pass through friendly obstacles at night, in fog, or under other conditions of poor visibility. Also use smoke screens because these conditions will not protect against many types of threat sensors. Lay smoke on a wide front, several times before actually executing the passage of lines.

There are three indicators caused by improper camouflage: shine, outline, and contrast with the background. Most targets on the battlefield are detected 10-1 MCRP 3-01A Rifle Marksmanship due to improper camouflage. However, many times an observation post or enemy firing position will blend almost perfectly with the natural background. Only through extremely careful, detailed searching will these positions be revealed. Shine is created from reflective objects such as metal or glass. It may also come from pools of water and even the natural oils from the skin. Shine acts as a beacon to the target's position. Most enemy soldiers will camouflage themselves, their equipment, and their positions. The outline of objects such as the body, head and shoulders, weapons, and web gear are recognizable even from a distance. The human eye will often pick up a recognizable shape and concentrate on it even if the object cannot be identified right away.

Added to that, the wood may be damp and it may be rain- ing heavily or be very windy. Unless the weather is very dry and has been so for days on end do not collect kindling wood from the ground. It will certainly be damp and in the morning after heavy dew, wood picked up from the ground will be far too wet to light. Get into the habit of collecting thin, dead twigs, no thicker than a match, which can be found on almost every shrub.

This author sat humbly in his basement as the tornado passed through. The experience dramatically changed his attitude about tornados potentially occurring in western Maryland. For the most part, wildfires are a western phenomena. This is not to say they can’t occur on the east coast, but generally, the east coast is too green and too wet to sustain major wildfires.

"explain best spot, since all the amplification and distribution equipment of the system","The Army’s normal distribution-based sustainment system reduces this burden significantly; however, available transportation assets (sea, air, and ground) impact delivery response times. These transportation assets often combine military assets overlaid on the host nation’s (and urban area’s) transportation and distribution infrastructure. Although the civilian infrastructure may initially support the Army’s distribution system, later effects of UO, such as destruction of equipment and facilities or loss of civilian workers, may degrade the system. Moreover, Army forces may have to share these assets with other military, multinational force, or civilian organizations participating in the urban operation, as well as with the indigenous civilian population at large. This shared system may put at risk the timely delivery of critical supplies to Army forces. Sustainment planners must understand the urban environment and its effects on the proposed method of distribution. They must also understand how urban operations (to include sustainment UO) may affect the urban environment. Storing bulk fuel or ammunition in or near an urban area, for example, may increase the risk of fire and explosive hazard to civilians and",0,-8.808600425720215,0.00014941993867978454,0
explain biological agents and first aid a,"of biological agents, dilute their concentration, and dehydrate them. The further downwind the agent travels, the less effective it becomes due to dilution and death of the pathogens. However, the downwind hazard area of the biological agent is significant and you cannot ignore it. Precipitation in the form of moderate to heavy rain tends to wash biological agents out of the air, reducing downwind hazard areas. However, the agents may still be very effective where they were deposited on the ground. Protection Against Biological Agents While you must maintain a healthy respect for biological agents, there is no reason for you to panic. You can reduce your susceptibility to biological agents by maintaining current immunizations, avoiding contaminated areas, and controlling rodents and pests. You must also use proper first aid measures in the treatment of wounds and only safe or properly decontaminated sources of food and water.

However, the weather forecaster can forecast the present weather at a given location for which observations are not available.

Weather Forecasts SWOs usually base weather support to current operations on observed current weather and on weather forecasts.

Surgical instruments: Options for sterilizing instruments in order of preference are: Pressure cooker or autoclave, oven (may damage instruments over time leading to cracks and possible breakage), isopropyl flaming (doesn't kill everything and eventually damages metal), and heating to red hot and letting cool (kills everything but damages metal - emergency use only), chemical soaking (generally doesn't kill everything), and boiling. Instruments with opposing surfaces (scissors, clips) should be sterilized open. There is a risk of sharp edge rust - wrap scalpel blades and individual scissor blades in a piece of paper with a single fold this serves to wick moisture away and prevent rust. - 47 - Survival and Austere Medicine: An Introduction The paper can be reused and in the case of scalpel blades used as a storage container for the blades.

Page 8 Solar Dehydrator PACKAGING AND STORING DRIED FOODS After foods are dried, cool them completely. Then package them in clean moisture-vapor-resistant containers. Glass jars, metal cans or freezer containers are good storage containers, if they have tight-fitting lids. Plastic freezer bags are acceptable, but they are not insect and rodent proof. Fruit that has been sulfured or sulfited should not touch metal. Place the fruit in a plastic bag before storing it in a metal can. Dried food should be stored in a cool, dry, dark place. Most dried fruits can be stored for 1 year at 60°F, 6 months at 80°F. Dried vegetables have about half the shelf-life of fruits. USING DRIED FOODS Dried fruits can be eaten as is or reconstituted. Dried vegetables must be reconstituted. Once reconstituted, dried fruits or vegetables are treated as fresh. To reconstitute dried fruits or vegetables, add water to the fruit or vegetable and soak until the desired volume is restored. (See Chart 1, Rehydrating Dried Food, for the amount of water to add and minimum soaking time.)",0,-8.559690475463867,0.0001916418841574341,0
explain smith) apples 1/2 c chopped onion 8 ea bacon strips,"SEASONING YOUR DUTCH OVEN The trick to a good dutch oven is proper seasoning prior to use. Old Ironware was coated with varnish or laquer to prevent rusting. ""Seasoning"" was a term which referred to scrubbing or burning off the coating. Modern day ovens still need a good washing in hot sudsy water and then completly dried. This is the only time you should ever wash your dutch oven in water. Next, heat your oven and boil greese in it. Use a clean rag to completly coat the inside, outside, top and bottom of your oven. When the greese starts to smoke, remove the oven from the heat and wipe it out. Leave a little grease as a protective coating. HEATING Although a dutch oven can be hung over an open fire it can also be buried in a pit of coals. For hole in the ground cooking, dig a pit larger and deeper than the dutch oven. Line it with small stones or you could even use aluminum foil to reflect the heat. Build your fire in the hole",1,7.984896659851074,0.999659538269043,1

Wars are not won by machines and weapons but by the soldiers who use them. Even the best equipped army cannot win without motivated and well-trained soldiers. If the US Army is to win the next war, its soldiers must be motivated by inspired leadership, and they must know how to do their jobs and survive on the battlefield. This is the soldier’s field manual. It tells the soldier how to perform the combat skills needed to survive on the battlefield. These are basic skills that must be learned by soldiers in all military occupational specialties (MOS).

If, during any part of the evaluation, the casualty exhibits the conditions (such as shock) for which the service member is checking, the service member must stop the evaluation and immediately administer first aid. In a chemical environment, the service member should not evaluate the casualty until both the individual and the casualty have been masked. If it is suspected that a nerve agent was used, administer the casualty’s own nerve agent antidote autoinjector. After providing first aid, the service member must proceed with the evaluation and continue to monitor the casualty for further complications until relieved by medical personnel.

In a permanent emulsion, the oil is held in suspension by the use of egg yolks or a combination of yolks and whole eggs. Oil is dripped slowly into vinegar and flavoring ingredients to form a temporary emulsion. The permanent emulsion is thicker than the temporary emulsion and it coats the salad ingredients better; the temporary kind must be stirred thoroughly or be shaken before serving. Mayonnaise, mayonnaise dressing, and mayonnaise salad dressing are semisolid dressings which are prepared by forming an emulsion of salad oil and beaten egg yolks. Mayonnaise is used as the base for many other very popular dressings such as thousand island, russian, and lamaze. Prepared french dressing and mayonnaise are issued to dining facilities.

"explain place the basket of vegetables in the pot, making sure the water","Food drying is one of the oldest methods of preserving food for later use. It can either be an alternative to canning or freezing, or compliment these methods. Drying foods is simple, safe and easy to learn. With modern food dehydrators, fruit leathers, banana chips and beef jerky can all be dried year round at home. How Drying Preserves Food Drying removes the moisture from the food so bacteria, yeast and mold cannot grow and spoil the food. Drying also slows down the action of enzymes (naturally occurring substances which cause foods to ripen), but does not inactivate them. Because drying removes moisture, the food becomes smaller and lighter in weight. When the food is ready for use, the water is added back, and the food returns to its original shape. Foods can be dried in the sun, in an oven or in a food dehydrator by using the right combination of warm temperatures, low humidity and air current. In drying, warm temperatures cause the moisture to evaporate. Low humidity allows moisture to move quickly from the food to the",1,2.2225286960601807,0.9022544622421265,1

"explain its energy density, helping the child to better meet its energy requirements","We can do 2 things to help meet such children’s energy needs: 1. Feed children more often —at least 5 times a day when a child is very young, too thin, or not growing well. Also give her snacks between meals. CHILDREN, LIKE CHICKENS, SHOULD ALWAYS BE PECKING. Also add high energy ‘helper foods’ such as oils and sugar or honey to the main food. It is best to add vegetable oil or foods containing oils—nuts, groundnuts (peanuts), or seeds, especially pumpkin or sesame seeds. If the child’s belly fills up before her energy needs are met, the child will become thin and weak. To meet her energy needs, a child would need to eat this much boiled rice. But she needs only this much rice when some vegetable oil is mixed in. High energy foods added to the main food help to supply extra energy. Also, 2 other kinds of helper foods should be added to the main food: When possible, add body–building foods (proteins) such as beans, milk, eggs, groundnuts, fish, and meat.",0,-7.313965320587158,0.0006657267222180963,0

"explain and fishing: fish are a valuable food source, containing protein, vitamins and","Emus are very common in outback areas and can be enticed towards bright objects waved by a person hiding behind a bush. As the bird's inquisitive nature leads it within metres of the object, the person can then step out and kill the bird with a suitable weapon.

Stealth, not speed, is of great importance when shooting and patience at a water hole at dawn or dusk is usually rewarded. 37 A I D S T O S U R V I V A L MARINE LIFE Fish are a valuable food source containing protein, vitamins and fats.

explain z on going reconstruction projects,"use several different methods to make the most of your crop. If you have only a small garden and a small family, perhaps freezing alone is all you need to consider. Read through the introductory sections on each method of preserving in Part 3, so you're aware of the space and equipment involved and the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Consider also the climate where you live and how much time you're able and willing to spend on preserving. At this point, as in your initial choice of w h i ch vegetables to grow, personal preferences are important. If your family hates turnips and only likes carrots raw, it's hardly going to be worthwhile to have a root cellar. If you're always on the run, it's pure fantasy to imagine yourself making preserves come fall. You may also want to investigate sharing the crop — and the w o r k.

The degree of slope which may be ascended using this method is limited by the holding characteristics of the wax used. With repeated backslapping of the skis, the slope should be tra- versed thereby decreasing the angle of climb, or a different method of climbing should be used. The sidestep is an effective method of climbing a short, steep slope, where space is confined; it may be the only practical means of ascending slopes. It is also useful for step- ping sideways over logs, stumps, and other obstacles. (1) (2) The skis are placed together and per- pendicular (at right angles) to the slope (fall line). To prevent slipping sideways, the uphill edges of both skis are forced into the snow by pushing both knees forward and toward the slope. Avoid leaning into the slope. Initially, the weight of the body is placed on the lower ski. The uphill is lifted in a sideways step up the slope (fig. 4-16) and the body 80",0,-8.602845191955566,0.00018354902567807585,0

Compost not only adds valuable nutrients to the soil at a slow pace, it improves soil texture—both in sandy soils and in clay soils—and makes a great mulch. It also provides a way for you to recycle your yard waste into a useful product. It’s no wonder many gardeners refer to it as “black gold.” Compost is created by mixing high-carbon and high-nitrogen materials proportionately with air and moisture. High-carbon materials include straw, hay, leaves, sawdust, shredded newspaper, and pine needles. High-nitrogen materials are generally succulent green plant parts such as grass clippings, weeds, perennial prunings, and vegetables.

Federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have programs to assist states and communities in reducing flood damages and promoting sound flood risk management. The authority to determine how land is used in floodplains and to enforce flood-wise requirements is entirely the responsibility of State and local governments. As emergency preparedness constitutes an important element of a comprehensive flood risk management framework, public and private levee owners and operators should consider undertaking emergency planning efforts in order to properly respond to potential flood events, and other natural or manmade incidents that could result in human casualties, property destruction, and economic losses.

Pass the free end of the cordage through the hole, and tie a slip noose that covers the perch. Tie a single overhand knot in the cordage and place the perch against the hole. Allow the cordage to slip through the hole until the overhand knot rests against the pole and the top of the perch. The tension of the overhand knot against the pole and perch will hold the perch in position. Spread the noose over the perch, ensuring it covers the perch and drapes over on both sides. Most birds prefer to rest on something above ground and will land on the perch. As soon as the bird lands, the perch will fall, releasing the over-hand knot and allowing the weight to drop. The noose will tighten around the bird's feet, capturing it. If the weight is too heavy, it will cut the bird's feet off, allowing it to escape.

Expiry dates simply reflect the longest period of time the drug companies are prepared to admit they have studied stability for. Several companies (probably most – but they don’t own up to having the data) have stability data extending 5 or 10 years beyond the expiry date on the packet. It has been cynically said that expiry dates are more about marketing, turnover, and profits than about patient safety.

explain vegetable protein is as high in quality as milk protein and thus,"make the switch to canned food. LOWER PROTEIN AND PHOSPHORUS LEVELS. Newer research has shown that the most important thing to restrict in early kidney failure is phosphorus. This mineral speeds up destruction of the remaining kidney cells. Stop all dairy products, as they are very high in phosphorus. Feed a specific, moderately reduced protein diet, such as a premium quality senior diet, in the early stages. As kidney failure advances, switch to a restricted protein diet. Mucous Membrane Color This refers to the normal pink color of your pets’ gums. Lift up your pets lips and examine the gums. They are normally a light pink color, although this is difficult to tell in breeds with dark pigmented gums. Assess your pet’s blood pressure by measuring capillary refill time. Press your index finger on the gums and count the time it takes for the pink color to return. Three seconds or less is normal. Greater than three seconds suggest low blood pressure, as is seen in cases of blood loss.

The results of this study further suggested that ginger did not act centrally on the vomiting centre, but had a direct effect on the gastrointestinal tract through its aromatic, carminative, and absorbent properties, by increasing gastric motility and ad- sorption of toxins and acids (22). In clinical double-blind randomized studies, the effect of powdered ginger root was tested as a prophylactic treatment for seasickness (26, 27).

Be sure to buy a significantly larger system than you think you need, to allow for peak energy usage and future increases in energy consumption. Other factors that will help you determine the size and features of the system you buy include: (1) Calculating power consumed by the bare minimum of lights and equipment you need during a power cutoff, when you are on backup system.

It is only when a fire is actually burning that they become alarmed. Therefore, smoking the trap parts is an effective means to mask your scent. If one of the above techniques is not practical, and if time permits, allow a trap to weather for a few days and then set it. Do not handle a trap while it is weathering.

explain optimal oxygen conservation requires a larger reservoir (oxygen economizer tube oet ),"As shown in Fig.32B, the admixed hydrogen/oxygen gas forces the water upward through the one-way check valve 410 and outlet tube 412 into the top reservoir 414. The one-way check valves 410,416 will not allow the water to drop back into the cylinder 404 or the first reservoir 402. This force equates to lifting the water over a distance. The gas inlet valve 408 then is closed, and the spark plug 418 detonates the gas mixture which causes an implosion (vacuum). Atmospheric pressure forces the water in reservoir 402 up through tube 420. Fig.32C shows the water having been transferred into the pump cylinder 404 by the previous action. The implosion therefore is able to 'lift' the water from the bottom reservoir 402 over a distance which is approximately the length of tube 420. The lifting capacity of the implosion pump is therefore approximately the total of the two distances mentioned. This completes the pumping cycle, which can then be repeated after the reservoir 402 has been refilled. Significant advantages of this pump are that it does",0,-8.937751770019531,0.00013131873856764287,0

Many Soldiers were married to Panamanians, and the Army had total access to local media and to prominent individuals. National imagery and special operations forces (SOF) also contributed to the ability of Army forces to assess the urban environments of JUST CAUSE. All units executing operations had detailed satellite photos of objective areas. Additionally, key objectives were placed under SOF surveillance well in advance. This surveillance revealed unit readiness, vulnerabilities, detailed disposition, and other patterns critical to mission success. The combination of the two capabilities allowed units to plan and achieve the synchronization necessary for such a complex urban operation. Shape During OPERATION JUST CAUSE, commanders conducted numerous shaping operations to establish the conditions for the decisive operations. Many operations were designed to control information, such as an assault on the Azul television tower identified during the assessment of the infrastructure. Planners designed many shaping operations to isolate various garrisons and PDF units.

Once the control force team has been alerted to a disturbance within the confinement facility, leaders further develop preplans to fit the situation much the same way that DOD develops war plans. During the planning process, leaders must be aware of the potential risks involved in quelling disturbances within a confinement facility. Careful planning minimizes collateral damage and risks to control force members and hostages. The use of NLW and NL munitions must also be considered when developing plans. There must be strict accountability and control of RCAs, their employment, and other appropriate NL means (such as high-pressure water hoses). When using RCAs, plans must be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the situation and weather because it impacts the effectiveness of some agents.

Larger herding animals such as elk or caribou roam vast areas and are somewhat more difficult to trap. Also you must understand the food choices of a particular species. You can with relatively few exceptions eat anything that crawls or flies. The first obstacle is overcoming your natural aversion to a particular food source. Historically people in starvation situations have resorted to eating everything imaginable for nourishment. A person who ignores an otherwise healthy food source due to a personal bias or because he feels it is unappetizing is risking his own survival. Although it may prove difficult at first a survivor must eat what is available to maintain his health. Insects The most abundant life-form on earth insects are easily caught. Insects provide 65 to 80 percent protein compared to 20 percent for beef. This fact makes insects an important if not overly appetizing food source. Insects to avoid include all adults that sting or bite,0,-8.126402854919434,0.0002955423260573298,0

"explain the nuts, and don't use blue corn masa, use white or yellow","by far with the blues, reds, and parti-colored varieties mostly being relegated to curiosities, though the blue and red corns have been gaining in popularity these last few years. These would be worth investigating if you can find a good source. It should be kept in mind that white corn does not have the carotene content (converts into vitamin A) of yellow corn. As vitamin A is one of the major limiting nutrients in long term food storage, any possible source of it should be utilized. For this reason I suggest storing yellow rather than white corn. Additionally, much of the niacin content of corn is chemically bound up in a form not available for human nutrition unless it has been treated with an alkali. This is really of importance only if most of your sustained daily calorie intake will come from corn, but grits, hominy (posolé) or corn masa (for tortillas and tamales) are traditional uses of this grain and can go a long way toward increasing the number of recipes you can make with corn.",0,-7.697838306427002,0.0004536012711469084,0

The latter are considered the most desirable for food, being more delicate and less gamey in flavor than the salt-water, or fish-eating varieties. The mallard, teal, muscovy, widgeon, and wood-chuck are familiar species of the inland birds, and the merganser and canvass-back are the two most esteemed salt-water varieties. Wild geese are common throughout North America, and may be seen either in the early spring or late fall migrating in immense numbers. They form a staple article of food in many parts of British America, and great numbers are salted down for winter supply. They are trapped in large numbers, as described on page 75, and are hunted with tame geese as decoys, the hunter being secreted behind a screen or covert, and attracting the game by imitating their cries. Fish form an agreeable change to the trapper's diet, and may be caught by the hook and line, or by spearing.

It should only be used when food is plentiful since it wastes most of the fat from the meat. Hot rocks beside the fire can be used as grilling surfaces. Place the large rocks on either side of the fire for the green sticks to rest on. Place the green sticks in grid formation on the rocks above the fire.

The snow cave must be high enough to provide comfortable sitting space. The sleeping area must be on a higher level than the highest point of the tunnel entrance, where there is warmer air. The roof must be arched for strength so that drops of water forming on the inside will not fall on the floor. This water will follow along the curvature of the roof and sides, glazing over the walls when frozen. The roof must be at least 30 centimeters thick. The size of the snow cave depends upon the number of men that will occupy it. A large cave is usually warmer and more practical to build and maintain than several small caves. The shape of the snow cave can be varied to suit conditions. When the main cave is built, short side tunnels are dug",0,-8.586786270141602,0.00018651987193152308,0

The same factors will kill somewhere around--perhaps more than--50 percent of the pre-war population immediately.ll Thus the up-front loss of food resources promises to”be far less serious from the standpoint of the survivors than the ensuing loss of crops due to nuclear winter. Especially if a nuclear winter were triggered during the growing season it can be expected that agricultural yields would be reduced to near nil. Certain survi- vors particularly those in rural areas might subsist for a time in some places up to 3 years on stored grains.

explain liquid crystal type assembly of native cellulose glucuronoxylans extracted from plant cell wall,"essential to understanding an animal’s overall health and maintenance. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are the basic energy source for all animals. There are two types of basic carbohy- drates; those associated with cell content and those associated with the cell itself. Starches and sugars are found within the cell wall and are easily broken down by the digestive system. Cellulose and hemi- cellulose are found inside the cell and require micro- organisms within the rumen or cecum to assist with digestion. Lignin is also found within the cell wall of a plant and cannot be fully broken down and di- gested. Lignin concentrations are typically higher in the stem of a plant as opposed to the leaf material and increases as the plant matures. Fats Range animals do not have the gastrointestinal sys- tem needed to break down fats, due to the absence of bile in the small intestine. Bile is produced by the liver and is the main component in the degradation of fat. A small amount of fat is necessary in an un- gulates diet.

If this is not possible, you must construct a form. Because most footings are rectangular or square, it is easier to erect the four sides of the form in panels. The following steps and figures helps explain this process: Step 1. Build the first pair of opposing panels (see [a] in Figure 4-7 to the footing width. Nail vertical cleats to the exterior sides of the sheathing. Use 2-inch dressed lumber for the cleats and space them 2 1/2 inches from each end of the exterior sides of the (a) panels and on 2-foot centers between the ends. Use forming nails driving them only part way for easy removal of the forms.",0,-8.948418617248535,0.00012992559641133994,0

Since sound moves much slower than light, one can judge how far away a lightning bolt is by counting the seconds between seeing the flash and hearing the thunder. Each three-second interval equals approximately one km. ACTIONS TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF A THUNDERSTORM A thunderstorm can arrive very fast and lightning can strike in front of the storm. Seek shelter well before the storm hits. The following is a list of facts and steps to take into consideration when in the presence of a thunderstorm. Calculate the Speed of the Approaching Storm Count the seconds between the flash and the thunder clap. Each second represents a 300-metre distance from the lightning strike. The speed and distance of the approaching storm can be calculated by comparing the time delay between the lightning and the thunder from several lightning strikes.

Normally, high rates of advance and heavy concentration of forces are difficult or impos- sible to achieve along mountainous avenues of approach. Relief features may create large areas of dead space that facilitate covert movement. Units may use difficult and unlikely avenues of approach to achieve surprise; however, these are extremely high-risk operations and are prone to failure unless forces are well trained and experienced in mountaineering techniques. In mountainous terrain, the analysis of avenues of approach should be based on a thorough reconnaissance and evaluated in terms of the factors listed in Figure 2-3 on page 2-8. As discussed in Chapter 1, weather and visibility conditions in the mountainous regions of the world may create unprecedented advantages and disadvantages for combatants.

This is extremely important because this means that the velocity of the end of the core is faster for the larger initial displacement. A pendulum on a grandfather clock behaves the same way. 28 The period is independent of the displacement but the velocity is not. The period of the core is dependent on its shape, mass and material; removing flakes changes its shape and mass, and therefore its period. However, it does not change appreciably with the removal of a single flake so knappers are able to adjust their behavior gradually and subconsciously. Pressure flaking is the application of a slowly increasing force. The force is applied so slowly that the entire core is able to bend or deflect in response to the gradually changing force. In different words, there are no inertia effects; the entire core and supports feel the pressure flaking force and respond to it.

Though an atom is far too small to be seen by the bodily eye, it is to the chemist a very real thing, and just as he supposes a diamond to be built up of millions of similar carbon atoms, so he imagines the minutest crystal of sugar to consist of millions of molecules, each of which is in itself a definite identical structure of so many atoms of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.

"explain at this point clearly points to massive disruptions, severe shortages in food","hundreds of suggestions for reducing your risk of being a victim. However, whatever you do, don’t allow yourself to be paralyzed by fear and use that as an excuse for doing nothing. That only guarantees that you WILL BE a victim, if not of terrorists, then of your own fear. Survival Principle #2: Stay healthy and fit If another terrorist attack damages your community either directly from a physical attack or indirectly as a result of disruption in basic services, shortages, or economic hardship, you must be as healthy and fit as possible to avoid possibly- severe repercussions. Chuck Fenwick of the Medical Corps says that in the event of a biochemical or radiological attack, the weak and sick will die first, while those who are strong and healthy may simply have a mild illness or may hardly be affected. If there is a national shortage of medicines as a result of a biochemical or 38 Surviving Terrorism radiological attack, you will be much more at risk if you are sickly.

They are suitable for most camping and bushwalking expeditions. The Tunnel Tent This type of tent is recommended as a compact 2-person, ultra-lightweight, double-skinned, expedition tent with good ventilation suitable for warm weather conditions as well as for travel in snow, across exposed country and in severe weather. The design is a classic two arch tapered tunnel with careful attention paid to equalising skin stress over the outer tent surface and to avoiding unnecessarily large areas of unsupported fabric. Access into the tent is usually provided at each side of the main arch. Both ends of the outer and inner can be fully unzipped for ventilation. Gear stowed under the vestibule should not hinder access to the tent.

Guerrillas in these sub- divisions must cooperate to form a primary force to counter- attack the enemy, or the area from which he came, while a secondary force harasses and hinders him.

The force of the magnetic field is responsible for the direction in which a compass needle is pointing, and decreases in strength as one nears the north magnetic pole. As one moves closer to the north magnetic pole, the compass will start to behave erratically, and eventually, as the horizontal force decreases even more, the compass will not point to north. Other natural phenomena, like earthquakes, can change the magnetic field locally. 4-1-2 A-CR-CCP-826/PF-001 A-CR-CCP-121/PT-001 (p. 5-33) Figure 4-1-2 Earth’s Magnetic Field Teaching Point 2 Time: 20 min Explain and Have the Cadets Identify the Cardinal Points Method: Interactive Lecture The four main directional indicators are called cardinal points.

The leaf stalks are red or green and grow up from a rhizome or underground stem, and the flowers are small and grow on top of a flower stalk. Don't allow the plant to reach the flowering stage; remove the flower stalk when it first appears. You eat only the rhubarb stalks; the leaves contain a toxic substance and are not for eating. Where and when to grow Rhubarb is very hardy and prefers cool weather. In areas where the weather is warm or hot, the leaf stalks are thin and spindly. Rhubarb can be grown from seed, but the plants will not grow ""true"" — which means they won't be the same variety as the parent plant.

Supply and equipment constraints are identified through analysis of on-hand supplies, naturally- available materials, and supplies available through military and indigenous channels. Careful procurement consideration is given to available civilian engineer equipment to supplement military equipment. INFORMATION ON INTELLIGENCE The maneuver force commander and engineer must have access to available intelligence information provided by staff elements. Battalion S2 sections provide the bulk of reconnaissance and terrain information, and experts at the division level and above assist the commander. For example, the DS terrain team, the production section of the division tactical operations center (DTOC) support element, and the corps cartographic company can quickly provide required terrain products. In addition, the commander uses the division intelligence system which provides the Threat order of battle and war-damaged key facilities. When reconnaissance requirements exceed the capability of battalion reconnaissance elements, maneuver or supporting engineer units collect their own information.

Some researchers have found that the breakdown responsible for the VAD field emission is promoted by Joule heating and vaporisation of microscopic emitter tips, and that this requires a critical current density (1012 A/cm2), while others emphasised that this explanation and these thresholds did not hold for large area emitters and that a space charge effect of concentrating the ion distribution near the cathode promoted breakdown under these circumstances, when the field reached a critical value; large field enhancement factors (more than a thousand- fold) have been postulated to explain the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental findings regarding the critical breakdown field values, and others have demonstrated how this critical field value effectively varies with work-function and electrode conditioning. The PAGD regime and its self-extinguishing auto-electronic emission mechanism stands as an exception to the high field emission theory as it currently stands with all its modifications, especially given that in this phenomenon we are confronted with a cathode emission that spontaneously occurs across the large gaps in large plate area pulse generators, at very",0,-9.238117218017578,9.72510824794881e-05,0

When you are reading or watching television, elevate your feet and rest your legs on a chair or stool. Mobility helps general circulation. Walking is beneficial as the movements of leg muscles help push the blood upwards. Swimming or walking in deep water does much the same thing.

Determining whether a particular soil will support vehicle passage or the con- struction of roads and airfields is just a part of the terrain analyst’s job. Since analysts also provide information on construction materials associated with roads and airfields, they need a variety of evaluation methods and a good working knowledge of the physical properties of soil. Type Determination For field identification and classification, soils may be grouped into five principal types: gravel, sand, silt, clay, and organic matter. These types seldom exist separately but are found in mixtures of various proportions, each contributing its characteristics to the mixture. Some soils may gain strength under traffic while others lose it. Gravel is angular to rounded, bulky rock particles ranging in size from about 0.6 to 7.6 cm (¼ to 3 inches) in diameter. It is classified as coarse or fine; well or poorly graded; and angular, flat, or rounded. Next to solid bedrock, well-graded and compacted gravel is the most stable natural foundation material.

The snag is, it was developed by the late Paul Baumann who was part of a Swiss commune which is not willing to explain its operation. This diagram was produced by Paul Potter in his attempt to back-engineer the device from the information available: Paul Baumann’s device may operate by creating a series of very short, high-power electrical discharges in the conductors passing through the centre of the two cylinders. These cylinders are effectively the same as Ed Gray’s discharge tube, both having metal shells around the pulsed conductor. The shells pick up the waves of Radiant Energy created by the electrical pulses and feed that energy to the workload. It would be easy to assume that Paul used a motor-driven version of a Wimshurst machine to pick up ‘static’ energy to 13 - 1 create the sparks, as shown below but reports from the commune state that the static electricity discs rotate on their own with no motor being use to drive them.

Colony traps and cable devices are also used for water sets. It is beneﬁ cial for beginning trappers to start with water sets as they are easier to make than dry land sets. Due to the location of the sets, water trapping is selective for semi-aquatic species and avoids most non-target animals.

The result is a network of protein molecules that hardens around air trapped in bubbles in the net. If you beat the whites too long, the foam will turn stiff enough to hold its shape even if you don’t cook it, but it will be too stiff to expand natu- rally if you heat it, as in a soufflé.

Modern packs are designed to do this and you can assist by placing heavy items high up in your pack and as near to the body as possible. Considerable experience is needed to keep pack weight to a minimum and to avoid anything but the essentials being carried. Inexperienced walkers are often inconsistent in their attitude to weight. Packs must always be weighed before departure and it is a good idea to keep placing them on bathroom scales while you are gathering your equipment. In this way if items have to be eliminated it will not have to be done in a hurry before setting out. Packing is largely common sense but it is necessary to balance conflicting needs.

Again, CO is a colorless, odorless gas, but it is even more dangerous. Generally, CO exposure causes a feeling of sleepiness in the victim, but also nausea, head- aches and vertigo. Once the victim becomes unconscious, death soon follows.

This immediately Page 22 acts on the trigger and causes the hammer to snap. By a few trials, the sticks can be arranged so as to spring the trigger easily, and where a hair trigger is used, a mere touch on the bait will suffice to discharge the gun. When all is found to work perfectly, the trap should be surrounded by a rude pen of sticks and branches, extending two or three feet beyond the muzzle, in order to insure an approach directly in the aim of the gun. The cap should now be placed on the nipple, after which the deadly device may be left to do its certain work.

Persons with high blood cholesterol level should drink at least eight to 10 glasses of water every day as regular drinking of water stimulates the excretory activity of the skin and kidneys. This in turn facilitates elimination of excessive cholesterol from the system. Regularly drinking of coriander (dhania) water also helps lower blood cholesterol as it is a good diuretic and stimulates the kidneys. It is prepared by boiling dry seeds of coriander and straining the decoction after cooling. Regular exercise also plays an important role in lowering LDL cholesterol and in raising the level of protective HDL. It also promotes circulation and helps maintain the blood flow to every part of the body. Jogging or brisk walking, swimming, bicycling and playing badminton are excellent forms of exercise. Yogasnas are highly beneficial as they help increase perspiratory activity and stimulate sebaceous glands to effectively secrete accumulated or excess cholesterol from the muscular tissue.

explain give a second rescue breath,"Stop rescue breathing and explain to the family what has happened. W h at to d o fo r th e b ab y Note: Doing rescue breathing has a small risk of passing infections between a baby and a midwife. Using gauze or a very thin piece of cloth to cover a baby’s mouth may help reduce that risk. Or you may be able to buy a mask for rescue breathing. It goes over the baby’s nose and mouth and the midwife breathes into it. Only use these masks if they are made specifically for this use. You may also be able to buy a bag and mask for rescue breathing. These bags can easily give just the right amount of air to the baby, but you must be trained how to use them.

The wearing of gloves and gowns is not recommended for household members providing care in the home. • Soiled dishes and eating utensils should be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with warm water and soap. Separation of eating utensils for use by a patient with influenza is not necessary. • Laundry can be washed in a standard washing machine with warm or cold water and detergent. It is not necessary to separate soiled linen and laundry used by a patient with influenza from other household laundry. Care should be used when handling soiled laundry (i.e., avoid “hugging” the laundry) to avoid contamination.

Glass jars, metal cans or freezer containers are good storage containers, if they have tight-fitting lids. Plastic freezer bags are acceptable, but they are not insect and rodent proof. Fruit that has been sulfured or sulfited should not touch metal. Place the fruit in a plastic bag before storing it in a metal can. Dried food should be stored in a cool, dry, dark place. Most dried fruits can be stored for 1 year at 60°F, 6 months at 80°F. Dried vegetables have about half the shelf-life of fruits. USING DRIED FOODS Dried fruits can be eaten as is or reconstituted. Dried vegetables must be reconstituted. Once reconstituted, dried fruits or vegetables are treated as fresh. To reconstitute dried fruits or vegetables, add water to the fruit or vegetable and soak until the desired volume is restored.

Improvise methods and supply sources, to include utilizing captured enemy supplies and equipment. • Use aviation assets to increase responsiveness. • Anticipate maintenance requirements. • Develop plans that place realistic demands on the CSS system. Mountain Supply Imperatives SECTION II – SUPPLY 5-7. Units operating in mountainous terrain transport supplies by a combination of wheeled vehicles, oversnow vehicles, indigenous pack animals and personnel (see FM 3-05.27), assisted by Army and Air Force lift assets. These combinations depend on equipment availability, location of combat units, type of terrain, and weather. However, any combination of resupply usually includes combat soldiers man-packing supplies to their positions. Since combat operations in the mountains are decentralized, CSS operations are correspondingly decentralized. This decentralization serves to create heavier man-loads, while rough, steep terrain decreases the amount soldiers are able to carry. Although most soldiers are eventually able to acclimate themselves to higher elevations, their pace and subsequently the overall pace of the entire operation slows down as elevation increases.

Because medical personnel will not always be readily available, the nonmedical service members must rely heavily on their own skills and knowledge of life-sustaining methods to survive on the integrated battlefield. This publication outlines both self-aid and aid to other service members (buddy aid). More importantly, it emphasizes prompt and effective action in sustaining life and preventing or minimizing further suffering and disability. First aid is the emergency care given to the sick, injured, or wounded before being treated by medical personnel. The term first aid can be defined as “urgent and immediate lifesaving and other measures, which can be performed for casualties by nonmedical personnel when medical personnel are not immediately available.” Nonmedical service members have received basic first aid training and should remain skilled in the correct procedures for giving first aid.

"explain they aren't too appetizing, but personal bias has no place in a",those that have somewhat fixed feeding areas and those that have trails leading from one area to another. Larger herding animals such as elk or caribou roam vast areas and are somewhat more difficult to trap. Also you must understand the food choices of a particular species. You can with relatively few exceptions eat anything that crawls or flies. The first obstacle is overcoming your natural aversion to a particular food source. Historically people in starvation situations have resorted to eating everything imaginable for nourishment. A person who ignores an otherwise healthy food source due to a personal bias or because he feels it is unappetizing is risking his own survival. Although it may prove difficult at first a survivor must eat what is available to maintain his health. Insects The most abundant life-form on earth insects are easily caught. Insects provide 65 to 80 percent protein compared to 20 percent for beef. This fact makes insects an important if not overly appetizing food source.

This is partly because many helper foods are expensive—especially those that come from animals, like milk and meat. Most people cannot afford much food from animals. Animals require more land for the amount of food they provide. A poor family can usually be better nourished if they grow or buy plant foods like beans, peas, lentils, and groundnuts together with a main food such as maize or rice, rather than buy costly animal foods like meat and fish. People can be strong and healthy when most of their proteins and other helper foods come from plants.

The ultimate success of caching may well depend upon attention to detail, that is, professional competence that may seem of minor importance to the untrained eye. Security factors, such as cover for the caching party, sterility of the items cached, and removal of even the slightest trace of the caching operations are vital. Highly important, too, are the technical factors that govern the preservation of the items in usable condition and the recording of data essential for recovery. Successful caching entails careful adherence to the basic principles of clandestine operations, as well as familiarity with the technicalities of caching. Section 1 Caching Considerations Caching considerations that are vital to the success of the caching operation may be done in a variety of operational situations.

explain south seas pork tenderloin spareribs with mustard sauce speedy barbeque sauce spice,"SEASONING YOUR DUTCH OVEN The trick to a good dutch oven is proper seasoning prior to use. Old Ironware was coated with varnish or laquer to prevent rusting. ""Seasoning"" was a term which referred to scrubbing or burning off the coating. Modern day ovens still need a good washing in hot sudsy water and then completly dried. This is the only time you should ever wash your dutch oven in water. Next, heat your oven and boil greese in it. Use a clean rag to completly coat the inside, outside, top and bottom of your oven. When the greese starts to smoke, remove the oven from the heat and wipe it out. Leave a little grease as a protective coating. HEATING Although a dutch oven can be hung over an open fire it can also be buried in a pit of coals. For hole in the ground cooking, dig a pit larger and deeper than the dutch oven.

Enzymes must act on the glycosides to release the cyanide. In the leaves, this ap- parently occurs when they wilt or, more importantly, when in the alimentary ca- nal of an animal or a person. Very little HCN remains in leaves that have been dried, however. So while it is possible that pyrolation releases HCN, it seems equally likely that the effects observed through bioassay are due to an as yet unidentified principle. Wow Taken Leaves are stripped from the branchlets and allowed to dry in the air. A few dried leaves are crushed and smoked in a small pipe. A lungful or two is enough.

"explain inhibited human platelet aggregation in vitro induced by arachidonic acid, collagen or","of the roots (200 mg/ml) or ferulic acid (0.4 mg/ml) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP or collagen in vitro (39). A hot aqueous extract of the roots (500 mg/ml) or ferulic acid (1 mg/ml) inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and release of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine from labelled platelets in vitro (39). An aqueous extract of the roots inhibited both ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation when administered intravenously to rats (200 mg/ml) (20, 39). The mechanism of action appears to be via inhibition of cyclooxygenase and throm- 30 Radix Angelicae Sinensis boxane A2 synthase by ferulic acid, leading to decreased production of throm- boxane A2 (40). The antithrombotic activity of the drug is associated with inhi- bition of platelet aggregation, reduction in the concentration of plasma ﬁbrinogen, changes in cell surface charge and a decrease in blood viscosity (20). Intraperitoneal administration of polysaccharides isolated from the roots increased haematopoiesis in mouse bone marrow, as determined by an increase in colony-forming units in the marrow cells (12, 41).

"explain of a few hours with the onset of violent storms, reduced visibility","between his defensive positions. (3) Terrain and weather. Terrain such as mountains, swamps, or heavy forests favors land infiltration. Deserts, arctic regions, and open prairies favor air or water insertion. Areas not inhabited or with a friendly but scattered population favor land infiltration. A heavily populated area, or one which contains large enemy forces, favors air or water insertion. Hydrography--tides, currents, surf, reefs, and sandbars--must be considered when planning water insertion. Bad weather with reduced visibility and high winds favors land infiltration, and adversely affects air or water insertion. Limited visibility favors land infiltration; good visibility does not. Adverse weather aerial delivery systems (AWADS) lessens the impact of reduced visibility as a limiting factor on air infiltration. High winds may preclude airborne insertion. The number of men to be inserted and their level of training may be limiting factors. A need for special skills may call for use of nonranger unit personnel whose physical stamina and ability to perform many infiltration techniques may not equal that of the rangers.

Most kinds of mushrooms are saprophytic—they feed off decaying organic matter—and as such, the woods is the place to go mushroom hunting. And hunting it is, for unlike foraging for plants, which can be found in the same place year after year, the search for mushrooms involves something more akin to hunting, with your eyes peeled, never quite knowing when one will show up. Places to look in urban areas include grassy spots, especially public parks with large trees. It is worth repeating the obvious: NEVER eat a mushroom (and this goes for plants too) unless you are sure of what it is and you know it is safe to eat. Even then, if it is your first time eating it, eat only a little to make sure you don’t have allergic reactions to it (also good advice for the first time you eat any new plant).

How you receive warning of an attack would depend on where you were. You might hear the warning given on radio or television, or from the outdoor warning system in your city or town. Many communities have outdoor warning systems that use sirens, whistles, horns, or other devices. Although they’ve been installed mainly to warn citizens of enemy attack, some local governments also use these systems to alert people to natural disasters and other peacetime emergencies. The Standard Warning Signals Two standard emergency signals have been adopted by most communities: The ATTENTION or ALERT SIGNAL is a 3- to 5-minute steady blast on sirens, whistles, horns, or other devices. In most places, this signal means the local government wants to broadcast important information. If you hear the attention or alert signal, turn on your radio or television and —stay tuned for news bulletins. The ATTACK WARNING SIGNAL will be sounded only in case of enemy attack.

explain material is also of great importance,"a better gas yield over a given electrode area. This particular configuration also causes the surface area of the anode to be extended and permits an arrangement in which the anode and cathode have equal surface areas which is most desirable in order to minimise electrical losses. It is also desirable that the anode and cathode surfaces at which gas is produced be roughened, for example by sand-blasting. This promotes separation of the gas bubbles from the electrode surfaces and avoids the possibility of overvoltages. The arrangement of the secondary transformer in which the central anode is surrounded by the cathode is also of great importance. The anode, being constructed of a magnetic material, is acted on by the magnetic field of transformer TR2 to become, during the period of energisation of that transformer, a strong conductor of magnetic flux. This in turn creates a strong magnetic field in the inter-electrode space between the anode and the cathode. It is believed that this magnetic field increases the mobility of the ions in solution thereby improving the efficiency of the cell.",0,-8.515366554260254,0.00020032553584314883,0

explain crafty animals will either have to take the bait at the risk,"and urine will increase your catch and help you avoid non-target animals. The more you learn about an animal and its habits, the better you will be at using lure, bait, and urine. Explain when and how to use bait, glandular lures, food lures, curiosity lures, and urine to attract speciﬁ c furbearers Bait, lure, and urine can be used alone or in combinations to help you trap furbearers. Scents should match the interests of the animal you are trying to catch. Baits are used to attract animals to your sets and make them stay longer. Your choice of bait and its placement is based on the furbearerʼs food source and eating habits. Baits can be chunks of meat and ﬁ sh, or plant food such as corn, carrots, and apples. Meat and ﬁ sh bait may be fresh, tainted, or liquid in form. Bait must be used carefully to prevent catching non-target wildlife or do- mestic animals. Pay close attention to trapping regulations concerning bait. Uncovered ﬂ esh baits are attractive to hawks and owls, which hunt by sight.",0,-8.801800727844238,0.00015043925668578595,0

ONE AGAINST TWO When fighting one against two, use the following procedures. Defeating two opponents simultaneously is very difficult. When outnumbered, you should usually try to remain standing—mobility is critical to an effective defense or escape. It is very important not to expose your back. You must use the obstacles around you to restrict the enemies’ movements so that you face only one at a time, or maneuver yourself to the flank of the one nearest to you and use him to block the other one. Attack the first enemy using strikes or field-expedient weapons, and then deal with the remaining one. Defense on the Ground. If you should lose your footing or be taken to the ground, you must protect your back. Your best defense is to move into a corner or against a wall.

Diazepam is effective for control and can be adminis- tered IV, endotracheally, or rectally, but should be used with caution. ♦ Airway control is essential. Vomiting is common and endotracheal intubation should be used in any patient with a reduced level of consciousness, or otherwise unable to protect the airway. Supplemental oxygen should be provided when available. ♦ Hypotensive patients who do not respond to saline should receive inotropic support. Careful titrated use of dopamine or dobutamine is reasonable and has the potential added advantage of improving renal perfusion. ♦ Pulmonary artery wedge pressure monitoring should be used in patients with persistent hemodynamic instability. ♦ Management of encephalopathy is supportive in nature and is directed at minimizing cerebral edema by avoiding fluid overreplacement and by assuring hemodynamic, thermal, and metabolic stability.

If one midwife becomes sick or cannot work, another midwife can help the women she was caring for. Midwives can also learn from and teach each other. In some communities, midwives and other health workers share information with each other, talking honestly about their work. Some midwives come together to meet every few months, compare information, and share resources. At midwife meetings you can: • take turns telling stories about births you have attended.

Aqueous extracts of the roots reduced the action potential amplitude and maximal upstroke velocity of the Q phase, and prolonged the effective refractory period and the duration of the action potential in guinea-pig myocardium (35). Intravenous administration of an aqueous extract of the roots (50 mg/kg body weight) to rabbits with ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery provided protection against ischaemia- and reperfusion-induced myocardial dys- function and injury (36). An aqueous extract of the roots bound to nitrendipine and diltiazem receptors, thereby demonstrating calcium channel blocking activ- ity (37). A ligustilide dimer, isolated from the roots, inhibited [3H]nitrendipine binding to dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC50] 0.4 mmol/l) (38). Since calcium channel blockers are known to have pronounced effects on the cardiovascular system, this activity may explain some of the reported effects of root extracts on the cardiovascular system.

"explain to disruption at any time, is to generate your own power","electrical power via an accumulator that provides the initial motion for the system. Already existing systems can generate electric power of whose duration depends on the lifetime of the battery. In these systems, the battery has to be reloaded in order to restart the system. 12V electrical power provided by the batteries used in cars is increased to 220 V via transformers. Two accumulators are used in our invention. The system works on a continuous basis after the initial start up via these accumulators. There is no need for another transformer. Our system, which generates electrical 13 - 12 power, does not need any other devices and it keeps on generating energy via its own mechanism. Also, the system works without connecting it to a network. Thus, it can be used at any place where no electricity exists. Nevertheless, when this system is connected to the entry of the buildings, there is no need for an additional network. The system can produce electrical power independent of a network.

It's easier for you, as a gardener, to provide shade where there's too much sun than to brighten up a shady area. You can, for instance, plant large, sturdy plants like sunflowers or Jerusalem artichokes to provide a screen, and you can design your garden so that large plants and small ones each get the light they need. You can also shade young plants with boxes or screens when necessary. However, too little sun is far more serious a problem in a garden than too much. How to make the most of your climate Whatever the climate is like where you live, you are not entirely at the mercy of the elements. There are certain improvements you can make to enable you to grow some vegetables that would not normally do well in your area. Don't expect miracles — you can improve conditions, but you can't change the climate. No amount of watering can change a desert into a vegetable garden; however, if the average rainfall in your area is reasonable, a",0,-7.857730388641357,0.0003866011102218181,0

Before Firing: Stabilize the Sights To fire an accurate shot, the sights must be stabi- lized prior to and as the bullet exits the muzzle of the pistol. A proper grip controls the alignment of the pistol’s sights and stabilizes the sights so an accurate shot may be fired. The following guide- lines apply to the establishment of a proper grip— (cid:79) There must be muscular tension in the wrist and forearms. Consistent muscular tension in the wrist, forearms, and grip helps maintain sight alignment by reducing the movement in the grip that can cause movement in the sights. The grip is correct when it allows the sights to be naturally aligned to the aiming eye. (cid:79) When establishing a two-handed grip, equal pressure must be applied with both hands. Consistent, equal pressure from both hands sta- bilizes the sights and allows them to be aligned and level with respect to the aiming eye.

By this means the climber can sit on the rope and rest. When using the abseil it will be found that bare feet, sandshoes or ones with ripple rubber soles made especially for such a purpose give a better grip than plain leather soles. Other uses for bush-made ropes Bush ropes have many other uses other than for descending or climbing rock and cliff faces. The following are but a few examples of uses to which they can be put. SINGLE ROPE LADDER WITH STICKS A single rope ladder is made by opening the lays of the rope and inserting sturdy cross sticks about 20-25 cm long with an equal amount protruding on either side. They must be secured to the rope by lashings both above and below. The distance between these ladder holds should be between 30 and 50 cm, depending on the agility of the climber.",0,-8.687777519226074,0.00016860596952028573,0

Wharves require several basic dimensions; careful measurement and precise identification of reference points is essential. Measurement may be in either feet or meters, since conversion tables are available. The length of one side of a pier may differ from that of the other, and both should be reported. The side of a pier or the face of a wharf may be irregular or stepped, and a dimension should be reported for each segment. Usable berthing space may or may not coincide with the overall length; shoals or other obstructions may decrease the usable length of a wharf. The width of a marginal wharf may be difficult to determine, since the inner limit may not be defined. In such cases, the measurement points should be clearly identified.

The nitre is now dried by gentle heat and constant stirring, and may be considered quite pure, and fit for the manufacture of gunpowder. As the value of crude saltpetre depends upon the quantity of pure nitre which it contains, it is important to give some simple methods of estimating its purity: 1.

This has come about because great numbers of people who have been oppressed by the enemy have de- cided to resist him, because of the participation of the Chinese Communists in the anti-Japanese war, and because of the fine work of the volunteer units. The guerrillas have finally educated the people to the meaning of guerrilla warfare, and in the northeast, it has again become an im- portant and powerful influence.

PURPOSE FOREWORD Marine Corps Reference Publication (MCRP) 3-01A, Rifle Marksmanship, provides the doctrine, techniques, and procedures for Marine Corps rifle marksmanship. SCOPE Every Marine is first and foremost, a rifleman. MCRP 3-01A reflects this ethos and the Marine Corps warfighting philosophy. This publication discusses the individual skills required for effective rifle marksmanship, and standardizes the techniques and procedures throughout the Marine Corps. It constitutes, the doctrinal basis for all entry level and sustainment level rifle marksmanship training. SUPERSESSION MCRP 3-01A supersedes the discussion of rifle marksmanship in Fleet Marine Force Manual (FMFM) 0-8, Basic Marksmanship and FMFM 0-9, Field Firing for the M16A2 Rifle. (The discussion of pistol marksmanship in FMFM 0-8 remains in effect until until superseded by MCRP 3-01B, Pistol Marksmanship, which is currently under development.) 4.

Limit your actions in the hide site to those discussed above. Once in the hide site, restrict all movement to less than 45 centimeters above the ground. Do not build fires or prepare food. Smoke and food odors will reveal your location. Before leaving the hide site, sterilize it to prevent tracking. Hole-Up Areas After moving and hiding for several days, usually three or four, you or the movement team will have to move into a hole-up area. This is an area where you can rest, recuperate, and get and prepare food. Choose an area near a water source. You then have a place to get water, to place fishing devices, and to trap game. Since waterways are a line of communication, locate your hide site well away from the water. The hole-up area should offer plenty of cover and concealment for movement in and around the area. Always maintain security while in the hole-up area. Always man the hole-up",0,-8.752238273620605,0.00015808203897904605,0

explain found them more abundant below tide water than above,"Manila clams and generally occupy the same depth (1-2 inches). Varnish clams are commonly found in the upper intertidal zone, and occasionally in the middle and lower intertidal zone. The varnish clam is more freshwater tolerant than other species, and the most abundant populations are found in areas where there are significant influxes of fresh water runoff. Varnish clams can be harvested recreationally in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. While not as popular as Manila clams, varnish clams are quite edible and are even used by some seafood restaurants in Washington. If you plan to harvest varnish clams from your beach, however, be aware that these clams concentrate biotoxins at higher levels than other clams and they hold onto the toxin for longer periods of time. Varnish clams are unique in that they are bimodal benthic feeders, meaning they can filter nutrients out of the sand while they wait for the tide to come in, which may account for the higher toxin levels typically observed in this species.

explain heating compress can be applied to the throat and joints,"involves the application of pressure on the joints such as the elbow, wrist, shoulder, knee, ankle, and fingers. Pressure can be applied in two ways: (a) Pressure is applied in the direction in which the joint will not bend. For example, joints such as the knees and elbows only bend in one direction and when pressure is applied in the opposite direction, pain compliance can be achieved. (b) Pressure is applied beyond the point where the joint stops naturally in its range of movement (i.e., it does not bend anymore). (2) There are breaking points on each joint. A slow steady pressure should be applied until pain compliance is reached. Continued pressure will break the joint and may escalate the violence of the situation. (3) Joint manipulation additionally uses the principle of off- balancing. A subject can be better controlled when he is knocked off balance. Safety Precautions During Training.

Various cephalosporins can be used for pneumonia urinary infections gut or pelvic infections bone infections and meningitis. Some like ceftriaxone can be useful for treating sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea (p. 359) eye infections in newborns appendicitis or peritonitis (p. 93).

explain freezing to the antennae may be removed by jarring the supports,"increased brittleness, may cause them to break. Antennas should have extra guy wires, supports, and anchor stakes to strengthen them to withstand heavy ice and wind load- ing. All large horizontal antennas should be equipped with a system of coun- terweights arranged to slacken before wire or poles break from the excess pressures of ice or wind. Soldiers may be able to remove wet snow and sleet that freezes to antennas by jarring their supports, or by attaching a hose to Chapter 2 the exhaust pipe of a vehicle and directing the hot air on the ice until it melts. However, soldiers must exercise great care to ensure that the antenna is not damaged in their attempts to dislodge the ice. Ground rods and guy wires are often difficult to drive into rocky and frozen earth. Mountain pitons are excellent anchors for antenna guys in this type of soil. In extreme cold, ropes can be frozen to the ground and guys tied to these anchor ropes.

I’m at a loss to explain this, but it’s probably worth keeping in mind. There seems to be a cumulative psychological effect upon survivors. This is clear even - or perhaps particularly - in those who were prepared for a disaster. During and immediately after the disaster, these folks were at their best, dealing with damage, setting up alternative accommodation, light, food sources, etc. However, after a few days in the heat and debris (perhaps worst of all being the smell of dead bodies nearby), many found their ability to remain positive and “upbeat” being strained to the limit.

explain have been a distinct subset of combat casualties,"i ii Emergency War Surgery THIRD UNITED STATES REVISION 2004 iii “All the circumstances of war surgery thus do violence to civilian concepts of traumatic surgery. The equality of organizational and professional management is the first basic difference. The second is the time lag introduced by the military necessity of evacuation. The third is the necessity for constant movement of the wounded man, and the fourth — treatment by a number of different surgeons at different places instead of by a single surgeon in one place — is inherent in the third. These are all undesirable factors, and on the surface they seem to militate against good surgical care. Indeed, when the over-all circumstances of warfare are added to them, they appear to make more ideal surgical treatment impossible. Yet this was not true in the war we have just finished fighting, nor need it ever be true. Short cuts and measures of expediency are frequently necessary in military surgery, but compromises with surgical adequacy are not.” —Michael E.

There are several fundamentals of the physical discipline of our martial arts that are used throughout any type of confrontation or situation. These fundamentals form the basis for all martial arts instruction and techniques. Additionally, you must prepare your body for the rigors of combat. To do so your body must possess the attributes of both toughness and flexibility. Like iron, you must be able to absorb and give out punishment but have the flexibility to prevent injuries. The proper execution of these fundamentals will enable you to effectively perform martial arts techniques that may very well save your life or the lives of fellow Marines one day. This lesson will cover the fundamentals of Marine Corps Martial Arts to include the purpose of close combat, ranges of close combat, weapons of the body, target areas of the body, pressure points, basic warrior",1,8.106856346130371,0.9996986389160156,1

The sugar is largely oxidised to carbonic acid and water, but aldehydes are also produced which remain in the liquid and add to its tanning effect (see Chap. XX), so that the leather is somewhat softer and fuller than that made with basic chrome alum. The tanning process is a very simple one. The goods prepared for tanning are entered in a weak liquor made by diluting one of the stock liquors above described, which is gradually strengthened by further additions until the goods are tanned. If carried out in a drum or paddle, skins can be tanned in a few hours, but for heavy hides suspension in pits is also a very practical method, though a much slower one.

explain diagnostic testing can provide results within 30 minutes,"sufficient for viral culture of clinical specimens from suspected pandemic influenza patients. Rapid diagnostic tests for influenza and immunofluoresence may be helpful for initial clinical management, including cohorting and treatment (see above). However, rapid influenza tests have relatively low sensitivity for detecting seasonal influenza, and their ability to detect pandemic influenza viruses is unknown. The sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests will likely be higher in specimens collected within two days of illness onset, in children, and when tested at clinical laboratories that perform a high volume of testing. Because during a pandemic a negative rapid test may be a false negative, test results need to be interpreted within the overall clinical context. For example, it may not be optimal to withhold antiviral treatment from a seriously ill high risk patient on the basis of a negative test; however, in a setting of limited antiviral drug availability, treatment decisions in less high risk situations could be based on test results. The risk of a false-negative test also must be taken into account in making cohorting decisions. Rapid diagnostic testing should not",0,-8.167376518249512,0.0002836809726431966,0

Sprouting is an excellent way to eat seeds, beans and grains in raw form. Sprouting increases the nutritional value of foods and many new vitamins are created or multiplied in seeds during sprouting. The patient should supplement the three health-building food groups with special protective foods such as milk, high quality cold-pressed unrefined vegetable oil and honey. The patient should also take natural vitamin and mineral supplements as an effective assurance against nutritional deficiencies, as such deficiencies have been found to be a factor in fatigue.

If pressure from the trigger finger is applied to the right side of the trigger or weapon, the strike of the bullet will be to the left. This is due to the normal hinge action of the fingers. When the fingers on the right hand are closed, as in gripping, they hinge or pivot to the left, thereby applying pressure to the left (with left-handed firers, this action is to the right). The firer must not apply pressure left or right but should increase finger pressure straight to the rear. Only the trigger finger should perform this action. Dry-fire training improves a firer's ability to move the trigger finger straight to the rear without cramping or increasing pressure on the hand grip. Follow-through is the continued effort of the firer to maintain sight alignment before, during, and after the round has fired. The firer must continue the rearward movement of the finger even after the round has been fired. Releasing the trigger too soon after the round has",0,-8.562549591064453,0.00019109484856016934,0

explain the various kinds of american cheese are most commonly used for cooking,"their high salt content. In the past, a slight amount of mold was commonly felt to be harmless and the food consumed anyway. For molds that were intentionally introduced, such as the mold in bleu cheese, this is fine. For the unintentional molds, it could possibly be a serious error in judgment. These unwanted molds could be producing toxic substances called mycotoxins which can be very bad indeed. Mycotoxins are produced around the root or mycelium of molds and these mold roots can penetrate deeply into the food. Mycotoxins can survive for a long time and most are not destroyed by cooking. The molds probably best known for this dangerous spoilage are the various Aspergillus species which produces a mycotoxin known as aflatoxin, but there are other dangerous fungi as well, such as the Fusarium molds. Both of the above affect grains and some legumes. See B.3 Molds In Grains and Legumes. IMPORTANT NOTE: In wet pack foods such as your home canned goodies, molds can do something else as well, possibly with lethal consequences.

M O L E S , V O L E S , A N D M I C E Moles are insectivores, eating mainly grubs and worms, so for the most part, they are beneﬁ cial in keeping insect populations in check. It is their shallow feeding tunnels that cause distress for gardeners. They often uproot plants as they tunnel along. Voles also build elaborate surface runway systems, 1 to 2 inches wide, with many burrows. Their runways and tunnels can also cause roots to dry out, creating problems for many shrubs. Voles can cause extensive damage to woody landscape plants in winter when they girdle the bark from the lower trunks. Voles and mice, both of which are plant eaters, often use mole tunnels",0,-8.823001861572266,0.00014728380483575165,0

It is well known that the rate of evaporation caused by a bubble of air passing unmolested through a liquid, is relatively slow due to the surface tension of the bubble. However, if the bubble is continuously broken, the surface tension of the bubble is reduced and a continual evaporating process occurs. This phenomenon is believed to be the cause of the high evaporation rate of the liquid fuel in the carburettor of this invention. Another feature of the carburettor of this invention is its ability to supply dry gas to the central mixing chamber 60 in housing 42. Since the flow of primary air in the central mixing chamber 60 is vertically upwards, the force of gravity will prevent any droplets of liquid fuel from rising high enough in the carburettor to enter the delivery tube 100. The delivery of dry gas to the delivery tube increases the efficiency of combustion and thereby reduces the amount of unburnt gasses or",0,-8.878064155578613,0.0001393943530274555,0

At the same time, the defender steps to the inside of the attacker off the line of attack and moves into position for the right-hip throw. Assistant instructors are able to move freely throughout the training formation and make on-the-spot corrections. EXECUTION AT COMBAT SPEED When the instructor is confident that the soldiers being trained are skilled at executing a technique by the numbers, he has them execute it at combat speed. Executing movements at combat speed enables soldiers to see how effective a technique is. This builds the soldier’s confidence in the technique, allows him to develop a clear mental picture of the principles behind the technique, and gives him confidence in his ability to perform the technique during an actual attack. For example, the command is, PASS THE GUARD AT COMBAT SPEED, MOVE. The soldiers then execute this",0,-9.053545951843262,0.00011696182627929375,0

One of the imperatives of current military doctrine is to conserve friendly strength for decisive action. Such conservation is aided through sound operations security (OPSEC) and protection from attack. Protection includes all actions that make soldiers, equipment, and units difficult to locate. DOCTRINAL CONSIDERATIONS 1-1. CCD degrades the effectiveness of enemy reconnaissance, surveillance, and target- acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. Skilled observers and sophisticated sensors can be defeated by obscuring telltale signs (signatures) of units on the battlefield. Preventing detection impairs enemy efforts to assess friendly operational patterns, functions, and capabilities. CCD enhances friendly survivability by reducing an enemy's ability to detect, identify, and engage friendly elements. Survivability encompasses all actions taken to conserve personnel, facilities, and supplies from the effects of enemy weapons and actions. Survivability techniques include using physical measures such as fighting and protective positions; nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) equipment; and armor. These actions include interrelated tactical countermeasures such as dispersion, movement techniques, OPSEC, communications security (COMSEC), CCD, and smoke operations (a form of CCD).

The ranges of the different radios vary depending on the altitude of the receiving aircraft, terrain, vegetation density, weather, battery strength, type of radio, and interference. To obtain maximum performance from radios, use the following procedures: • Try to transmit only in clear, unobstructed terrain. Since radios are line-of-sight communications devices, any terrain between the radio and the receiver will block the signal. • Keep the antenna at right angles to the rescuing aircraft.

Fertilizing and watering Fertilize before planting and again at midseason, at the same rate as the rest of the garden. Detailed information on fertilizing is given in ""Spadework: The Essential S o i l"" in Part 1. Keep the soil evenly moist; squashes need a lot of water in hot weather. The vines may wilt on hot days because the plant is using water faster than the roots can supply; if the vines are getting a regular supply of water, don't worry about the wilting — the plants will liven up as the day gets cooler. If squash vines are wilting first thing in the morning, water them immediately. Special handling If you grow squashes indoors, or in an area where there are no insects to pollinate the female flowers — your 51 st-floor balcony, for instance — you may need to pollinate the flowers yourself.

The agency/provider’s goal is to maintain continuity of care, ensure patient and staff safety, and mitigate harm. In order to provide continuity of care during an evacuation or sheltering situation, agency staff, patients and their families must be aware of current events, options, transportation needs and shelter access information. In Michigan, incidences that may result in the need for evacuation are most likely to occur due to wind damage, flooding, winter storms and there is a possibility of nuclear power plant incidents. Agencies should have a policy for evacuation incidents since these have occurred and may occur in the future. Policies must include: • Staff education and definition of their role in evacuation situations; and • Procedures to be taken if a patient refuses to evacuate. The following are some procedural considerations if a patient refuses to evacuate: • Assessment and documentation of the patient's understanding of the impact of their choice and the patient's assuming responsibilities for that choice; • Variations of response based on the",0,-8.490062713623047,0.0002054581418633461,0

explain fewer rats to spread the fleas,"Ticks can carry and transmit diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever common in many parts of the United States. Ticks also transmit the Lyme disease. Mosquitoes may carry malaria, dengue, and many other diseases. Flies can spread disease from contact with infectious sources. They are causes of sleeping sickness, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery. Fleas can transmit plague. Lice can transmit typhus and relapsing fever. The best way to avoid the complications of insect bites and stings is to keep immunizations (including booster shots) up-to-date, avoid insect-infested areas, use netting and insect repellent, and wear all clothing properly. If you get bitten or stung, do not scratch the bite or sting, it might become infected. Inspect your body at least once a day to ensure there are no insects attached to you. If you find ticks attached to your body, cover them with a substance, such as Vaseline, heavy oil, or tree sap, that will cut off their air supply.

And still there is the novelty—stuffed grape leaves are not what the forager is expected to show up with. Most people have no idea of the number of wild grape plants they pass by on every highway trip. Some are pointed, some are more rounded like these, but all grapes leaves have a glossier upper side and a softer and whiter underside, and the climbing stems always fork into two tendrils. Grape leaves are best in early summer when they are large but still young and light green. Look for the tendrils that help the plant climb up onto other plants (a clever bit of 65 Urban Foraging evolution—instead of forming a costly sturdy trunk, they just climb up someone else’s). Grape tendrils fork into exactly two branches, and the grape leaves are pointed like maple leaves. The top side of the leaf is smooth, the underside textured by the leaf veins.

explain him is against his mother s skin,"to keep things clean enough to prevent the baby from getting diarrhea and other sicknesses. • The temperature of breast milk is always right. • Breast milk has things in it (antibodies) that help protect the baby against certain illnesses, such as diarrhea, measles, and polio. The mother should give her breast to the baby as soon as he is born. For the first few days the mother’s breasts usually produce very little milk. She should continue to nurse her baby often—at least every two hours. The baby’s sucking will help her produce more milk. If the baby seems healthy, gains weight, and wets her diaper (nappy) regularly, the mother is producing enough milk.

The hatchet and knife will now come into excellent use, in cutting the sticks for the little inclosure shown Page 45 in our drawing. This should be about eight or ten inches in diameter, and of about the same height. The sticks should be driven into the ground in a circle, leaving an open space of about six inches on one side. A stout switch as large as a man's little finger, and nearly two feet long, should then be cut and nicely sharpened at both ends. This should then be driven into the ground in the form of an arch, at the opening of the inclosure.

"explain best spot, since all the amplification and distribution equipment of the system","The force requires protection at all levels since the enemy often expects the force's arrival, and since assembly areas are limited until specific missions are developed. Due to the light force structure and limited logistical support, priorities are established to determine where the engineers should dedicate their resources. Conditions such as delayed supply and resupply operations, and scarcity of engineer equipment, demand force maneuver units or light forces to prepare their own fighting and protective positions. The situation will determine whether shifts from those priorities are necessary. 5-28 APPENDIX A SURVIVABILITY EQUIPMENT This appendix contains powered survivability equipment used in engineer operations.

However, with a shotgun these aids aren’t essential, because of its wide impact area. I hope it goes without saying that you have to actually fire a shotgun on many occasions (at a range, in a safe rural area, etc.) before you expect to use it effectively as a defensive weapon. A shotgun is a frightening weapon to fire and usually has a very strong kick, which can break your hand if you don’t hold it properly.

The antitumour action of IL-12 is complex and uses effector mechanisms of both innate resis- tance and adaptive immunity. So, speciﬁc recognition of tumour antigens might not always be required for the effects of IL-12. Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8C T cells, NK cells and NKT cells) are often involved in the mechanism of action of IL-12, but their cytotoxic activity is not required in some cases for their anti-tumour activity. IFN-γ and a cascade of other secondary and tertiary pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that are induced by IL-12 have a direct toxic effect on the tumour cells and/or might activate potent anti-angiogenic mechanisms. The ability of IL-12 to induce antigen-speciﬁc immunity relies mainly on its ability to induce or augment the responses of Th1 cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (see also Chapter 15 and ﬁgures",0,-8.027726173400879,0.0003261828678660095,0

explain hybridization studies show that ginsenoside rb1 increases the expression of choline acetyltransferase,"AP-1, upregulation of upstream binding factor (UBF), an RNA polymerase I-speciﬁc transcription factor, increased sensitivity to cisplatin in cell cultures. Downregulation of UBF with antisense oligodeoxynu- cleotides caused weak apoptosis without DNA laddering or cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and altered the expression of 30 genes (Huang et al., 2002). Additional genes that might be involved directly or indirectly to cisplatin resistance include BclXL, bcl-2, Pms2, ERCC1 and XPA. Frequently observed genetic changes using comparative genomic hybridization in human tumour cell lines (predominantly ovarian) with acquired resistance to cisplatin included ampliﬁcation of 4q and 6q, followed by ampliﬁcation of 5q; ampliﬁcation of 12q was observed in cell lines made resistant to JM216 or ZD-0473 (platinum analogues, see Boulikas and Vougiouka, 2003 for references) in which increased DNA repair appeared to be the major mechanism of resistance for both agents (Leyland-Jones et al., 1999).

"explain antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, and the greater efficiency of","The emergence of drug resistant strains is less likely during treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) than with M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine). Neuraminidase inhibitors may also have a lower incidence of severe side effects (see July 2005 recommendations of the AHIC (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/ rr/rr5408.pdf ). Oseltamivir and zanamivir should therefore be reserved for treatment whenever possible. Because supplies of oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently depleted, early depletion of oseltamivir and widespread use of M2 inhibitors could lead to increased rates of side effects and drug resistance. Strategies for treatment Treatment strategies for optimizing the use of limited stocks of antiviral drugs will vary depending on the phase of the pandemic. The following interim guidance will be updated as more information becomes available. Strategies for consideration include: At all stages of a pandemic: • Targeting therapy to influenza patients admitted to a hospital who present within 48 hours of symptom onset. • Implementing mechanisms to detect the emergence of drug-resistant variants of a pandemic influenza strain (e.g., obtaining specimens from persons who develop influenza while on prophylaxis or",0,-4.766861915588379,0.008435274474322796,0

Once while walking down a quiet back street in Boston, I noticed a well-tended vegetable garden with a pile of recently weeded purslane piled up at the edge of the plot. That was an easy bunch to decide upon. A trickier patch I came across the same day was purslane growing out of a gravel cover. I immediately concluded the gravel cover was an indication that the owner of the building had tried to cover up the only patch of dirt on his property, to make his life easier, and so I was ready to hit that purslane patch. However, friends with me at the time suggested that maybe the plants were put there on purpose, since they can grow in poor and rocky soil, and maybe this owner was trying to re- greenify his property one small plant at a time. I was doubtful, but erred on the side of optimism and let those purslane plants go. 86 David Craft Purslane growing in some compacted, sandy",0,-7.4054951667785645,0.000607533729635179,0

Also there are many other tasks that may need doing which I’ll touch on later, but they are more specialized and not, to my mind, as likely to be important. When considering what type of weapons to purchase, you also have to think about how many to get.

A small amount of fat is placed on a grill or in a frying pan and is heated; the vegetables are then added and are cooked until a light, golden coat or crisp outer surface is developed. Finely shredded vegetables with high water content are sautéed in a small amount of fat. The liquid from the vegetables add flavor and moisture to the finished product. Frequently, diced bacon is used (instead of oil, shortening, or butter) by first lightly sautéing the bacon and then adding the vegetables. Sautéed or pan-fried vegetables must be stirred frequently to avoid scorching.

Never bandage a wound tightly with gauze bandage or any- thing else. This will restrict circulation and can cause pain and severe problems and even gangrene.

Net energy estimates are used largely by dairy producers in ration balancing for maintenance (NEm), gain (NEg), and lactation (NEl). Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF): An estimate of the portion of a forage sample that is in the walls of a plant cell. It is measured by boiling a forage sample in a neutral detergent and weighing the residue. Boiling removes the soluble components of the cell - most of the sugars, fats, starches, and proteins. The remaining residue is composed of cell walls made up of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The amount of NDF residue is inversely related to forage intake. High quality forages have low amounts of NDF. Nitrate Poisoning: Condition sometimes resulting when",0,-8.98122501373291,0.00012573289859574288,0

Notice that the joists rest on top of the girder. This type of girder is commonly used in frame building construction. To make a built-up girder, select lumber that is as free from knots and other defects as possible. Built-up girders are usually made of three pieces of framing lumber nailed together. (The pieces must be nailed securely to prevent individual buckling.) For proper arrangement of the pieces of lumber, the end grains should match the example in Figure 6- 13. The nailing pattern should be square across the ends of the board (1 1/2 inches from each end) and then diagonal every 16 inches as shown in Figure 6-13. This pattern increases the strength of the girder. A typical two- or three- piece girder of 2-inch lumber should be nailed on both sides with 16d common nails.

Also active during the Revolutionary War were Thomas Knowlton's Connecticut Rangers. This force of less than 150 hand-picked men was used primarily for reconnaissance. Knowlton was killed leading his men in action at Harlem Heights. Another famous Revolutionary War Ranger element was organized by Francis Marion, the ""Swamp Fox."" Marion's partisans, numbering up to several hundred, operated both with and independent of other elements of General Washington's army. Operating out of the Carolina swamps, they disrupted British communications and prevented the organization of loyalists to support the British cause, thus substantially contributing to the American victory.

Helicopter Air-Landing - The short range of present day helicopters requires that there be 10. air-landing facilities for fixed-wing transport aircraft within helicopter range of the enemy lodgement. This air-landing facility would provide the means to stockpile fuel, and if necessary, to fly in dismantled helicopters.

Consolidation may also include activities in support of the civilian population such as relocating displaced civilians reestablishing law and order humanitarian assistance and relief operations and restoration of key urban infrastructure. A significant consolidation effort may be the reduction or elimination numerous explosive hazards resulting from previous urban combat operations. During consolidation commanders often coordinate with NGOs to establish unity of effort in the execution of stability or civil support operations. Consolidation begins with the initiation of the urban operation and follows each critical activity. TRANSITION 6-23. When planning UO commanders ensure that they plan prepare for and manage transitions.

explain the baby should learn to breastfeed normally and start to gain weight,"to keep things clean enough to prevent the baby from getting diarrhea and other sicknesses. • The temperature of breast milk is always right. • Breast milk has things in it (antibodies) that help protect the baby against certain illnesses, such as diarrhea, measles, and polio. The mother should give her breast to the baby as soon as he is born. For the first few days the mother’s breasts usually produce very little milk. She should continue to nurse her baby often—at least every two hours. The baby’s sucking will help her produce more milk. If the baby seems healthy, gains weight, and wets her diaper (nappy) regularly, the mother is producing enough milk. It is best for the baby if the mother gives him only breast milk for the first 6 months. After that, she should continue to breastfeed her baby, but should begin to give him other nourishing foods also (see p. Mothers with HIV should stop breastfeeding when the baby is 12 months old if they can give enough other nutritious foods.",0,-8.350959777832031,0.00023611400683876127,0

The equality of organizational and professional management is the first basic difference. The second is the time lag introduced by the military necessity of evacuation. The third is the necessity for constant movement of the wounded man, and the fourth — treatment by a number of different surgeons at different places instead of by a single surgeon in one place — is inherent in the third. These are all undesirable factors, and on the surface they seem to militate against good surgical care. Indeed, when the over-all circumstances of warfare are added to them, they appear to make more ideal surgical treatment impossible. Yet this was not true in the war we have just finished fighting, nor need it ever be true.

Our bond had been so tight that when I was first abducted, Shane didn’t know how to break it to her. She told Destiney that I was working all day long and was only able to call very late at night. (I used to call home every single day.) At first, Destiney didn’t understand, but as the days passed by without her talking to me, she began to miss me more and more. She was only nine years old at the time. She was told that I was calling late at night, so she started to stay awake, waiting for my call. Each night she would stay awake later and later, waiting for me to call, until she was up all night long. Hearing this account of her suffering filled me with an intense and straining pain that nothing could alleviate.

It’s easy enough that anyone can learn. Yet it’s complex enough to ensure you won’t run out of new things to discover. It combines the satisfaction of identifying birds with the thrill of improving your duck calling and wingshooting skills. Below are tips to help you master the basics. Clothes Make the Man (or Woman) . The right clothes can mean the difference between happiness and hypothermia. Ducks are mighty fond of water so if you’re going to see them, you’ll need to get aquatic, too. A pair of insulated neoprene waders will keep you warm and dry when you’re stomping around marshes, ponds and rivers. You’ll also want a specialized waterfowler parka with an outer fabric of gortex or a similar windproof/waterproof material. It should also have a lightweight insulating material such as Thinsulate.

FMFRPs in the 12 Series are a special category of publications: reprints of historical works which were published commercially and are no longer in print. SCOPE This reference publication is Mao Tse-tung’s thoughts and philosophy of guerrilla warfare. It gives the reader a chance to learn about this type of warfare from one who lived and fought as a guerrilla for most of his adult life. It is important to understand his philosophy of guerrilla warfare because it is the basis of today’s guerrilla forces. The book was translated and published with an introduction by Samuel B.

It is gratifying that the importance of the monographs is already being recognized. For example, the European Com- mission has recommended volume 1 to its Member States as an authoritative reference on the quality, safety and efﬁcacy of medicinal plants. The Canadian Government has also made a similar recommendation. Furthermore, as hoped, some of WHO’s Member States, such as Benin, Mexico, South Africa and Viet Nam, have developed their own monographs based on the format of the WHO monographs. The monographs are not only a valuable scientiﬁc reference for health authorities, scientists and pharmacists, but will also be of interest to the general public. There can be little doubt that the WHO monographs will continue to play an important role in promoting the proper use of medicinal plants through- out the world.

At the thermocouple, low frequency pulsed abnormal glow discharges can also be seen to increase the vacuum significantly. These results suggest instead the presence of a pumping mechanism in the PAGD which is somewhat analogous to that of sputter ion pumps, where collision of ionised gas molecules with the cathode is responsible for the sputtering of cathode material that either combines with the gas substrate (`gettering` action) or `plasters over` the inert gas molecules on to the anode (a process known as `ion burial`). These are the two basic pressure reducing actions of sputtered getter atoms, in ion pumps.

Microscopic characteristics The transverse section of the rhizome is characterized by the presence of mostly thin-walled rounded parenchyma cells, scattered vascular bundles, deﬁ- nite endodermis, a few layers of cork developed under the epidermis and scattered oleoresin cells with brownish contents. The cells of the ground tissue are also ﬁlled with many starch grains. Epidermis is thin walled, consisting of cubical cells of various dimensions. The cork cambium is developed from the subepidermal layers and even after the development of the cork, the epidermis is retained. Cork is generally composed of 4–6 layers of thin-walled brick- shaped parenchymatous cells. The parenchyma of the pith and cortex contains curcumin and is ﬁlled with starch grains. Cortical vascular bundles are scattered and are of collateral type. The vascular bundles in the pith region are mostly scattered and they form discontinuous rings just under the endodermis.",0,-9.233322143554688,9.771847544470802e-05,0

Legal preparedness While the federal government is primarily responsible for preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the U.S., state and local health authorities may also take measures, such as quarantine of ill travelers and their contacts, to prevent the spread of communicable diseases within their borders. State and local authorities are primarily responsible for restricting travel within their borders while the federal government may take measures to prevent the interstate spread of communicable diseases. Because jurisdictions and authorities at airports and other ports of entry overlap, local, state, and federal health authorities should establish protocols and outline roles and responsibilities in advance of a public health emergency. To be adequately prepared for management of travel-related risks, state and local health departments should: • Ensure that legal authorities for the isolation of ill persons and the quarantine of exposed persons (at the local, state, and federal levels) are known and understood (see Supplement 8). • Develop procedures for addressing overlapping multi-jurisdictional issues.",0,-8.904047966003418,0.00013581950042862445,0

Old Ironware was coated with varnish or laquer to prevent rusting. ""Seasoning"" was a term which referred to scrubbing or burning off the coating. Modern day ovens still need a good washing in hot sudsy water and then completly dried. This is the only time you should ever wash your dutch oven in water. Next, heat your oven and boil greese in it. Use a clean rag to completly coat the inside, outside, top and bottom of your oven. When the greese starts to smoke, remove the oven from the heat and wipe it out. Leave a little grease as a protective coating. HEATING Although a dutch oven can be hung over an open fire it can also be buried in a pit of coals. For hole in the ground cooking, dig a pit larger and deeper than the dutch oven.

Pigeons and all grain eaters MUST have water, but the flesh eaters such as the crow, hawk and eagle can go without water for a long time.

Emphasis is placed on the basic ground fighting techniques, gradually introducing standup fighting and fight strategy. Studying the new techniques in this method ensures that the movements are correctly programmed into the soldiers’ subconscious after a few repetitions. Once a unit has developed a sufficient proficiency level in basic skills, begin the walk phase. Instructors introduce soldiers to more advanced ground fighting techniques and begin serious training on closing with the enemy and takedowns. Soldiers engage in full sparring and competitive matches. In the run phase, soldiers spar using slaps to represent striking during ground fighting, takedowns are practiced against an opponent with boxing gloves, and scenario driven training such as multiple opponent or restrictive equipment is used.

Preparing ahead for events creates hope of survival despite dire situations where food, water, or safe shelters are in short supply. Though “preppers” are often referred to in (implied) derogatory terms like “doomsdayers”, the fact is that a host of natural and man-made events around the world from hurricanes to war have proven that planning ahead for disasters, or any kind of crisis no matter what form it takes, makes sense. Preppers are not doomsdayers. They are strategic planners who look ahead, anticipate certain events, and logically and methodically prepare",1,8.107624053955078,0.9996988773345947,1

explain of movement on the battlefield,"the battle will unfold, correctly anticipate the decisive points on the battlefield, and position themselves at these critical points. The success of a unit conducting mountain operations depends on how well leaders control their units. Control is limited largely to a well- thought-out plan and thorough preparation. Boundaries require careful planning in mountain operations. Heights overlooking valleys should be included in the boundaries of units capable of exerting the most influence over them. These boundaries may be difficult to determine initially and may require subsequent adjustment. During execution, leaders must be able to control direction and speed of movement, maintain proper intervals, and rapidly start, stop, or shift fire. In the mountains, soldiers focus mainly on negotiating difficult ter- rain. Leaders, however, must ensure that their soldiers remain alert for, understand, and follow signals and orders. Although in most instances audio, visual, wire, physical signals, and messengers are used to main- tain control, operations may be controlled by time as a secondary means. However, realistic timetables must be based on thorough reconnaissance and sound practical knowledge of the mountain battlefield.",0,-8.529041290283203,0.00019760530267376453,0

While we’re harvesting, younger plants will just be starting, so we dig wild carrots many times from the first harvest to the last. If the season lasts quite a while, we dig them until they are through. Right at the point where the stem con- nects to the root the plants are very, very delicate.

Public Shelter Management Many public fallout shelters are located in large commercial buildings. Depending on what the building contains, there may be some food, water, and living supplies which people Page 23 could take advantage of. If you are evacuating from one area to another to stay in a public shelter, take as much nonperishable food and drinking water as you can, any special foods or medications needed, a blanket for each family member, and a portable radio with extra batteries. (See suggested supplies for evacuation on pages 14- 15.) Water, Food, and Sanitation in a Public Shelter At all times and under all conditions, human beings must have sufficient water, adequate food, and proper sanitation in order to stay alive and healthy. With people living in a shelter—even for a week or two—water and food may be scarce, and it may be difficult to maintain normal sanitary conditions.

The aircraft may return to the ship while the ranger force conducts the mission, they may orbit offshore, or they may stay at the LZ. Other aspects of landing and assembling are the same as discussed for helicopter insertions. This form of insertion combines helicopters and small boats in the same operation. It is planned and conducted the same as air assault operations, except that the LZ is in the water. While helicopters are moving at low levels and low speeds, rangers drop small boats and jump into the water. They then assemble, climb into the boats, and move to shore.

(d) Salt water and other impurities. NOTE: The strength of ice depends upon ice structure, purity of water, freezing process, cycles of freezing and thawing, crystal orientation, temperature, ice thickness, snow cover, water current, underside support, and age. Special Considerations (1) Immediately adjacent to the shore, the ice formation is thin and weak and more likely to develop cracks than ice in the center of a frozen stream. Depending upon the gradient of the riverbed and the thickness of the ice near the shore, it is generally safer to maintain a route near the shore if the ice rests upon the river bottom.

Detailed Description of the Invention The invention draws energy from the aether. To understand why the invention works, one needs to understand the process by which the aether stores energy when an electric field is set up across the dielectric separating two capacitor plates. Moreover, one needs to understand the means by which the aether determines the quantum of action, specifically in the form of the Bohr magnetron and the unit of angular momentum linked to Planck's constant. It is not sufficient to imagine that electric charge in the aether is displaced from a rest position in a background continuum of opposite charge polarity to which it is attracted by a restoring",0,-9.023536682128906,0.00012052452802890912,0

However, the doses were estimated to be approximately 30–50 times higher than normal therapeutic doses (123). Photosensitization in light- sensitive individuals has been demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial involv- ing metered doses of hypericin and exposure to ultraviolet A and B irradiation. Patients were treated with 600 mg of a hydroalcoholic extract of the herb (con- taining 0.24–0.32% total hypericin) three times daily for 15 days. A measur- able increase in erythema in light-sensitive individuals was observed after ultraviolet A irradiation. The plasma concentration of hypericin and pseudo- hypericin in these subjects was double that seen during normal therapeutic treatment of depression (124).

Each part of a compass has a specific name used to identify the part and its function. The cadets will rely on this information throughout navigation and survival training. Teaching Point 1 Time: 15 min Explain the Principles Behind the Workings of a Compass Method: Interactive Lecture The compass is an important tool used in wilderness navigation. Be precise when using a compass, a small error in calculation or measurement can equal a significant error in the field. 4-1-1 A-CR-CCP-826/PF-001 Even with the advent of Global Positioning System devices, a magnetic compass remains a viable navigation aid because it does not require batteries and remains reliable year after year. The Chinese discovered the orientating effect of magnetite, or lodestone, as early as the 4th century BC. In 101 BC, Chinese ships reached the east coast of India for the first time, possibly with help from a magnetic compass. By the 10th century, they had developed a floating compass for",0,-8.95257568359375,0.00012938669533468783,0

Cranberry juice decreased the urinary pH, whereas the excretion of oxalic acid and the relative su- persaturation for uric acid were increased, indicating the potential for the development of urinary stones (44). Adverse reactions One rare case of immune-related thrombocytopaenia has been reported in a 68-year-old patient (45). Nausea and severe vomiting were reported in a 4-month-old infant after administration of 180 ml of cranberry juice (46). Contraindications The use of cranberry for the treatment of diseases of the urinary tract in paediatric populations is ineffective and is not recommended (22, 43). Warnings Patients with kidney stones or impaired kidney function should use products containing the fruit only after consulting their health care provider (47).

Like most forage grasses, Siberian Wildrye nutrient levels are highest just before the plant develops its seedhead. There is limited Siberian Wildrye research data available concerning actual nutritional value, palatability, and grazing utilization. Distribution and Adaptation Siberian Wildrye is distributed across Europe, Asia, Russia, and parts of Canada and Alaska. It can be found growing in sandy soils, in areas receiving between 24 and 55 inches of annual precipitation. Siberian Wildrye is a very drought tolerant species and will not grow well in wet areas or areas with poorly drained soils. The grass is adapted to slightly acid to neutral soils, with a pH range from 5.0 to 7.2. Siberian Wildrye will not tolerate saline soils or shaded environments.
