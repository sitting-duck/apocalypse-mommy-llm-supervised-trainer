Its active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite, kills viruses, bacteria, mold, fungi, and protozoa on contact by denaturing their vital proteins. Bleach is effective, inexpensive and widely available making it a good choice for use as a disinfectant and purifier. Unscented household bleach is recommended because they can be used for water purification, disinfection, and cleaning. In the US, household bleach usually contains 6% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, color safe bleaches, or bleaches with added cleaners. Because the potency of bleach diminishes with time, use bleach from a newly opened or unopened bottle. Plain unscented household bleach (6% sodium hypochlorite) is the most practical way to purify a large quantity of water. For adults the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends adding 16 drops (1/8 teaspoon) of household bleach to each gallon of drinking water to get rid of virus, mold, fungi, bacteria and protozoa. This treatment is not safe for infants until it has been run through a good filter. Allow the water to sit for 30 minutes after",

Chlorine is sensitive to both the pH and temperature of the treated water. Temperature slows the reaction for any chemical treatment, but chlorine treatment is particularly susceptible to variations in the pH as at lower pHs, hypochlorous acid is formed, while at higher pHs, it will tend to dissociate into hydrogen and chlorite ions, which are less effective as a disinfectant. As a result, chlorine effectiveness drops off when the pH is greater than 8. Chlorine, like iodine, will not kill Cryptosporidia.

Wilderness Survival: Food & Water FINDING FOOD & WATER In a wilderness survival situation, it is possible to live for extended periods of time on little or no food. Research shows that a healthy individual can survive on 500 calories a day with no side effects and with plenty of water and a comfortable resting place can live approximately three weeks without food. During cold weather or periods of heightened activity more food is required to maintain a normal body temperature. Water is much more important. Two to three cups of water are required each day to stay healthy. It is wise to conserve the",

Leaving and Returning to the Site When searching for water or finding higher ground to build a signal fire, the survivor may have to walk for a kilometre or more. Blazing will help to establish the route and if one loses their sense of direction they can follow it back to the survival site.

Dried wood placed in the lower branches are ignited so that the flames flare up and ignite the foliage. A torch tree will burn for a long time, leaving one free to attend to other signals. A Luminous Cone Fire. A luminous cone fire is a tripod with a platform to support a fire. The poles are driven/ dug into the ground to prevent the tripod from tipping over in the wind. The platform keeps the tinder off damp ground and stores more firewood beneath it. It is covered with evergreen boughs",

In hot weather, on the other hand, evaporation is essential in cooling the body to prevent heat illnesses. - From The Backpackers Field Manual by Rick Curtis. Thermoregulation is balancing the heat a body loses to the environment with the heat generated from exercise. An example of proper thermoregulation is when heat production and heat retention are greater than the cold environment. If the environment is greater than heat production and heat retention then a person is susceptible to hypothermia or frostbite. Heat can be produced in the body by exercise and by shivering. Some of the heat retention factors include: m body size and shape (the surface-to-volume ratio affects how quickly heat is lost) 35 m insulation (type of clothes and layering affects",

Similarly, if you cannot remember which part of the plant is used leave it alone. Check your personal tolerance to ANY new edible wild plant before consuming in quantity. If you have a medical condition or are taking medication then you should seek professional medical advice before consuming edible wild plants as they may contain constituents that impair or amplify that medication. Be 'aware' of the environment that you are gathering from. Is there possible contamination from effluent, car exhaust emissions, sprays, dogs and so on?

Before building your shelter be sure that the surrounding area provides the materials needed to build a good fire, a good water source and shelter from the wind. Wilderness shelters may include: 1. Natural shelters such as caves and overhanging cliffs. When exploring a possible shelter tie a piece of string to the outer mouth of the cave to ensure you will be able to find your way out. Keep in mind that these caves may already be occupied. If you do use a cave for shelter, build your fire near its mouth to prevent animals from entering. Enlarge the natural pit under a fallen tree and line it with bark or tree boughs. Near a rocky coastal area, build a rock shelter in the shape of a U, covering the roof with driftwood and a tarp or even seaweed for protection. A lean-to made with poles or fallen trees and a covering of plastic, boughs, thick grasses or bark is effective to shelter you from wind, rain and snow.",

Examples Of Thatching Using Tufts and Fronds Use Of Debris Once you have constructed the skeletal structure for your shelter in cold or wet weather you should consider the use of debris for protection and insulation. Over the framework heap a pile of light, soft debris. Leaves, grasses, brush, or any type of leaf litter will do. The debris should eventually form a large dome shaped mound some 60cm thick over the structure. Remember the thicker the pile the better the insulation and the steeper the pitch the better the rain protection. On top of the debris add some bark slabs or moss to form a protective waterproof layer and to assist in keeping it together. Low debris shelters built using this method are sometimes called ‘oven shelters’",

Use landscape features such as cliffs and overhangs which can protect you from rain and wind. If you are in the open grasslands, sit with your back to the wind and pile any equipment behind you as a windbreak. Bough Shelter Make use of branches that sweep down to the ground or boughs that have partly broken from the tree to give basic protection from the wind.

Wooded areas provide timber for shelter construction, wood for fire, concealment from observation, and protection from the wind. NOTE: In extreme cold, do not use metal, such as an aircraft fuselage, for shelter. The metal will conduct away from the shelter what little heat you can generate. Shelters made from ice or snow usually require tools such as ice axes or saws. You must also expend much time and energy to build such a shelter. Be sure to ventilate an enclosed shelter, especially if you intend to build a fire in it. Always block a shelter’s entrance, if possible, to keep the heat in and the wind out.

Answers to commonly-asked questions Will the cooker work in winter (in the United States)? As the sun moves closer to the southern horizon in the winter, the solar cooker is naturally less effective. A good measure of the solar intensity is the “UV index” which is often reported with the weather. When the ultraviolet or UV index is 7 or above – common in summer months – the solar cooker works very well. In Salt Lake City in October, the UV index was reported to be 3.5 on a sunny day.

Improved sun drying for fish A solar tent dryer can be used for solar drying. This is the simplest and cheapest way of solar drying. Solar dryers work by retaining the heat of the sun’s rays. A higher drying temperature and thus greater drying speed can then be achieved. The moisture content of the final product is lower than that achieved with conventional sun drying. All this means that the chance of spoilage occurring during the drying process and storage is smaller. The higher temperatures in a tent dryer slow down bacterial growth on and in the product and kill insects and their Drying 43 larvae if they are present in the product.

Buy the best-quality hand-pump available (cast-iron pumps available from Lehman’s) and a good cylinder. They will last a lifetime if installed properly. With this setup, you’ll have a near-unlimited supply of water. The total cost of doing this, depending on where you live, ranges from about $4000 - $6000. If you’ve got the money, I think so.

Under suitable conditions, the effect can be harnessed to provide motive power. 11 - 61 One of the techniques which has been used is shown above. Here, steam under 55 psi pressure is forced into a tubular structure through a ring orifice. That steam then passes through a doughnut-shaped nozzle where it hits a stream of heavily aerated water. The bubbles in the stream of water are drawn in by the venturi effect of the water flow past small apertures in the tube. The result is a rapid series of water hammer shock waves which, because of the shape of the shock wave chamber, boost the water as it exits from the tube.

Fresh vegetables contain large quantities of water; for example, asparagus contains 93 percent water. Fresh vegetables have an abundance of cellulose. Cellulose is the fibrous part of vegetables that furnishes essential bulk for the diet. Because cooking softens cellulose, the extent of cooking and the method chosen for cooking vegetables should be geared to the amount of cellulose present. Some parts, such as stems, of fresh or frozen vegetables contain more fiber than do other parts and, for this reason, require long cooking. Root vegetables, such as beets, are also fibrous and require longer cooking time than some other vegetables. Most raw vegetables have waste material which is not edible.

Kleck found that 99% of the time when people used guns to defend themselves against intruders, no one was injured – neither the homeowner nor the intruder. In virtually every case, the intruder ran away. Almost none of these incidents are ever reported to police, since homeowners don’t want to be bothered with paperwork nor risk prosecution. Kleck estimates that American civilians use their guns up to 2.5 million times every year defending themselves against muggers, burglars, rapists and other assailants.

The critical soldiering skills of move, shoot, and communicate must be trained, practiced, and sustained at every level in the schools as well as in the unit. The map reading and land navigation skills taught at each level are critical to the soldiering skills of the duty position for which he is being school-trained. Therefore, they are also a prerequisite for a critical skill at a more advanced level. A soldier completing initial-entry training must be prepared to become a team member.

METHOD OF EVALUATION N/A. CLOSING STATEMENT It is important for the cadets to be able to determine direction using the sun in a survival situation so they can navigate to and from their survival site without the aide of a compass or map. INSTRUCTOR NOTES/REMARKS There will be more time required than is allocated in TP 2 to observe the change of the sun’s effect on the shadow stick. It is recommended that the shadow stick be constructed close to the exercise site, in order to allow the cadet to observe the changes.

Recently, astronomers were able to watch another solar system crossing the plane of the galaxy and see what happened to it, and in that case, there were massive solar flares. Observations of another solar system which did that recently, showed that their sun flared up and created major radiation.

When drill seeding, furrows are created and the seed is placed in the soil furrow at a controlled depth and covered with a relatively pre- cise amount of soil. Drill seeders are used most of- ten in agricultural settings. The drill seeding method is considered by many to be the best method of dis- tributing seed. It is an effective means for establish- ing a high yield stand, using a smaller amount of seed compared to the broadcast method. One type of drill seeder, the Brillion style, is often used for planting forage. This seeder has been suc- cessfully used on most soil types, except very gravel- ly soils. The Brillion seeder delivers the seed into the soil, packs the seed in place, and applies seed with high accuracy.

Your bondage is exactly that - your bondage, and the whole idea is to have fun, right?

Traditionally, slow sand filters have been made of concrete and pipe. The innovative use of molded polyethylene structures has distinct advantages. First, the engineering cost is reduced because it is amortized over the number of filters manufactured. Second, the cost of producing polyethylene filter vessels is much less than the construction and pouring of concrete forms. Finally, the materials used in polyethylene components can be certified as non-toxic, while materials for cast-in-place filters require testing of each installation. Additional advantages of polyethylene slow sand filters include transportability, durability and rapid set-up time.

Rapid sand filters filter at a rate of 1 to 2 gallons per minute per square feet (gpm/ft2) and use physical straining to trap solids in the pores between sand particles throughout the bed. To increase the capacity to filter, rapid sand filters often use flocculent (polymers) to stick particles together into larger particles that can then be more easily strained out. To clean the filter, flow is reversed through the filter bed at a high rate that fluidizes the bed, actually expanding the spaces",

Most manufacturers recommend a filter change after a certain volume of water has passed through the filter. Some AC units actually meter the water and automatically shut down after a specific quantity of water has passed through the filter. A general rule of thumb for high-volume AC filters is to change the filter after six months of use or 1000 gallons of filtered water. Tests done by Rodale Press Product Testing Department indicated that filtering performance was reduced dramatically after 75 percent of the manufacturer's recommended lifetime. These results suggest that filters should be changed more often than suggested by the manufacturer. Some AC filters are claimed to last for five years, because they are rechargeable with hot water (145 degrees F). The heat is supposed to release adsorbed organic chemicals.

NOTE: Once you have successfully trapped an animal, you will not only gain confidence in your ability, you will also have resupplied yourself with bait for several more traps. Traps and snares crush, choke, hang, or entangle the prey. A single trap or snare will commonly incorporate two or more of these principles. The mechanisms that provide power to the trap are usually very simple. The struggling victim, the force of gravity, or a bent sapling’s tension provides the power. The heart of any trap or snare is the trigger. When planning a trap or snare, ask yourself how it should affect the prey, what is the source of power, and what will be the most efficient trigger. Your answers will help you devise a specific trap for a specific species. Traps are designed to catch and hold or to catch and kill. Snares are traps that incorporate a noose to accomplish either function.",

Snares are made from non- ferrous wire with a running eye at one end through which the other end of the wire passes before being firmly anchored to a stake, rock or tree. A snare is a free running noose which can catch small game around the throat and larger game around the leg. TYPES OF SNARES Simple Snare. A simple snare may be made of brass wire, string, plant cordage, roots, horse hair, rawhide, dried animal guts, etc. The best material for constructing a simple snare is non-ferrous wire because it keeps its round shape and is easily twisted to make a loop through which the moving part of the wire will slide. A squirrel trap is made with several small nooses on an inclined log. The squirrel will pass its head through the noose and fall off the log.

TRAPS AND SNARES For an unarmed survivor or evader, or when the sound of a rifle shot could be a problem, trapping or snaring wild game is a good alternative. Several well-placed traps have the potential to catch much more game than a man with a rifle is likely to shoot. To be effective with any type of trap or snare, you must-- • Be familiar with the species of animal you intend to catch. • Be capable of constructing a proper trap. • Not alarm the prey by leaving signs of your presence. There are no catchall traps you can set for all animals. You must determine what species are in a given area and set your traps specifically with those animals in mind. Look for the following: • Runs and trails. • Chewed or rubbed vegetation. • Nesting or roosting sites. • Feeding and watering areas.

Applicability and Cross-Reference to Plans: Licensee State X Local X Tribal X TO MEET THE INTENT OF EVALUATION CRITERION J .14 .e, ORO PLANS/PROCEDURES INCLUDE: i. Methods for monitoring and decontamination of individuals who are being relocated from areas not previously evacuated. EXPLANATION It may be necessary to provide monitoring and decontamination services to populations identified to be in a relocation area that were not previously evacuated. Reception centers already identified for use during the emergency phase of an incident may be used. It may be more appropriate to use monitoring and decontamination stations set up in the buffer zone if they are already established. Using monitoring and decontamination stations inside the buffer zone around the relocation area has the benefit of reducing the potential for spread of contamination. Resources are identified to support continued use of receptions centers or monitoring and decontamination stations established in the buffer zone and are consistent",

The sandbags are not allowed in NRA competition. Archery Before the invention of bow sights, string peeps, string releases, etc., many hours of practice were essential for an archer to be- come proficient with the bow and arrow. Now, after learning the techniques, constant practice is not as critical as it once was. However, it is essential for every archer to practice before and during the season. This is necessary for discovering limitations, and it is important to only take shots within those limitations. The biggest problem for most archers is judging distances. Some hunters use colored ribbons to indicate various distances when the same stand is used repeatedly.

Getting involved in ham radio will teach you how to build highly-efficient antennas basic electronics and troubleshooting good operating techniques and even give you a chance to experiment with other potentially useful communications methods such as morse code com- puter/digital satellite communications and more. The down-side to ham radio is that the equipment is extremely complex. You will not (and let me make this absolutely 100% clear) you will NOT simply pull a ham radio out of the box and start using it. It takes a few weeks to master the basics and years to become truly proficient. These radios often have thousands of features require detailed programming and complex antenna configurations. The likelihood of damaging your equipment (or hurting someone) is also relatively high if you don’t understand the science behind it. Too many people get their ham license buy a radio and tuck it in their go-bag never to think about it again.",

The phenomenon, known as hydrogen bonding, creates a rigid structure in which the molecules stretch out rather than pack closely together, as normally happens when a substance is cooled. An ounce of frozen water (ice) takes up more room than an ounce of liquid water. “Softening.” Home water softeners that filter out “hard” calcium carbonate and replace it with sodium may increase the sodium content of tap water by as much as 100 mg per quart. Medical Uses and/or Benefits Maintaining body functions. The body uses water in and around body cells and tissues to regulate body temperature; create blood, lymph, and body secretions; digest food; dissolve and circulate nutrients; eliminate waste; and lubricate joints. Protection against dental cavities. Fluoridated drinking water provides fluoride ions that are incorporated into the crystalline structure of dental enamel, hardening the tooth surface and making it more resistant to bacteria such as Mutans streptococcus, a type of bacteria that live in sticky dental plaque, digesting sugars and excreting",

As the commercial canning industry is not interested in reusing the containers, metal cans make great sense for their purposes. The cans are both cheaper (for them) and lighter than glass jars. This adds to the economy of scale that makes canned foods as cheap as they are in the grocery store. For home canning, glass jars are better because even the smallest of towns will usually have at least one business that carries pressure and boiling water canners along with jars, rings and lids.

Use the roots for the frame, then add additional branches or boughs as a windbreak and dig into the ground to improve the shelter. Be cautious as water tends to pool at the base of the roots during rainfall. Dangers to using a cave include: high tide, since caves are usually formed by wave action; occupants such as, snakes, bats, bears; there may be pitfalls; smoke inhalation if the fire is inside; and water rushing in during a storm.

According to a systematic review from the World Health Organisation (WHO), household water treatment and safe storage is associated with a 39 % reduction in diarrhoeal disease morbidity.11 • Solar water disinfection Solar water disinfection is an effective method using solar radiation to disinfect water in PET bottles. It will be described in more de- tail in the chapter “Solar water disinfection” (see page 42). • Chlorination Chemical disinfection with chlorine destroys and inactivates pathogens efficiently. It will be described in more detail in the chapter “Chlorination” (see page 50). • Boiling Boiling water is a simple, very effective but often expensive method to sterilise water. • Filtration Different filtration systems, such as slow sand, ceramic or membrane filters are used for water treatment.

But if unprepared citizens were confined in a shelter, they soon would realize that they should have given first priority to storing adequate water. Therefore, having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergency. A normally active person needs to drink at least two quarts (half gallon) of water each day. People in hot environments, children, nursing mothers, and ill people will require even more. You will also need water for food preparation and hygiene.

As a result, elevated environmental temperature adds to the heat burden of the body and can interfere with heat dissipation. Heat Transfer Mechanisms. Keeping in mind the above principle we will now discuss the four methods of heat transfer. 1) Conduction: This is heat exchange between two surfaces in direct contact. An example would be lying on a hot or cold surface. 2) Convection: This is heat exchange from a surface to a gas or liquid, usually air or water.

The principle of trapping air within the fibers or layers of clothing provides the most efficient method of insulating the body against AGO 8641A heat loss. Fur provides warmth in the same way; warm, still air is trapped in the hair and is kept close to the body.

Bivalve shellfish and crab ingest this algae, where the toxin concentrates. Significant amounts of domoic acid can cause Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) in humans when contaminated shellfish are consumed. Unsafe levels of domoic acid have been detected in razor clams and Dungeness crab in coastal waters and mussels, clams, and oysters in Puget Sound areas. Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and abdominal cramps within 24 hours of ingestion. In more severe cases, neurological symptoms develop within 48 hours and include headache, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, loss of short- term memory, motor weakness, seizures, profuse respiratory secretions, cardiac arrhythmias, coma and possibly death.

Robust and well- coordinated reconnaissance, tactical dispersal, and use of advance guard security forces protect against this threat (see Defensive Combat Power: Suez City vignette in Chapter 8). The pursuit is designed to destroy threat forces attempting to escape. It focuses on the threat and not on urban areas. When conducting a pursuit, Army forces move through undefended urban areas and, if possible, bypass those in which threat forces successfully take refuge. The threat will likely attempt to use urban areas to disrupt the pursuit and permit the threat main body to escape. Commanders can prevent escape by denying the threat the time to establish forces in urban areas that cannot be bypassed. The agility of Army aviation forces for attack, reconnaissance, and transportation is essential to execute a successful pursuit around and through urban areas. URBAN OFFENSIVE CONSIDERATIONS 7-40.

The considerations can vary depending on the level of war at which the operation is conducted, the type of defense, and the situation. Most issues discussed may, in the right circumstances, apply to both commanders conducting major UO and commanders at lower tactical levels of command. The commander defending in the urban area must assess many factors. His mission statement and guidance from higher commanders help him focus his assessment. If the mission is to deny a threat access to port facilities in an urban area, the commander’s assessment will be focused much differently than if the mission is to deny the threat control over the entire urban area. The mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations (METT TC) structure guides the commander’s assessment.

Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the potential costs of urban operations and risk reduction measures that the commander and his staff must consider early in their planning. These chapters also outline an urban operational framework and specific urban considerations that create the foundations necessary for successfully applying operational doctrine to an urban environment.

Urban operations include major offensive and defensive operations in urban environments as well as stability or civil support operations ranging from peace operations and counterterrorism to disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.

Under the right circumstances, a consideration may become an operational issue, a tactical issue, or a combination of the two. The following identifies some planning and execution issues that commanders conducting major operations should address. The first requirement, and a continuing requirement throughout the conduct of urban operations, is the assessment and understanding of the situation. Commanders should base this understanding on detailed information regarding the particular urban area.

Demographic, health, safety, ethnic, and cultural concerns will be essential considerations in most UO. Other situational factors—the mission, enemy, and time available— dictate the balance between the level of detail and analysis to support the overall urban operation with the level of detail that commanders and their staffs can achieve. However, an analysis that fails to devote enough time and resources to understanding the urban society can find large elements of the population turned against the Army force.

These boundaries, regions, or areas often stem from some historical, religious, political, administrative, or social aspect that could also be considered a characteristic of the urban society. Overlaps can also occur in a specific category, such as infrastructure. For instance, dams are a consideration for their potential effects on transportation and distribution (mobility), administration and human services (water supply), and energy (hydroelectric).

Compartmented effects force the attacking threat to move on well-defined and easily interdicted routes and limit the threat’s ability to flank or bypass delaying positions. The urban area’s transportation and distribution network facilitates retiring forces that are not in contact. Properly used, the urban transportation system can quickly move large forces and associated resources, using port facilities, airfields, railheads, and well-developed road networks. 8-8 FM 3-06 26 October 2006 Urban Defensive Operations URBAN DEFENSIVE CONSIDERATIONS What is the position about London?

Sustainment planners must assess whether they can acquire and use urban resources and infrastructure without overly disrupting the urban society and their environment. If the resources are only sufficient for the urban area’s inhabitants (and dependent populations in outlying areas), and the facilities cannot increase production to accommodate the needs of Army forces, then commanders may not be able to rely on those resources to support their operations. In fact, the opposite may be true. The effects of UO on the inhabitants, particularly during offensive and defensive operations, may place increased burdens on the Army’s resources. For example, commanders may require civilians to evacuate all or parts of an urban area to safeguard them from the effects of planned combat operations.

Moreover, the human or civil considerations gain importance in civil support or stability operations regardless of the echelon or level of command.

Frequent temperature changes shorten storage life. If you don’t have a cool place for your food storage, plan on rotating your storage quickly enough to prevent food loss. Factor #2: Product moisture content: By looking at the USDA nutritional tables, dry beans, grains, and flours contain an average of 10% moisture. Although it is very difficult and unnecessary to remove all moisture from dry foods, it is imperative that any food be stored as dry as possible. Foods with excess moisture can spoil right in their containers. This is an important consideration when packing food with dry ice as moisture condenses and freezes on the outer surface of the dry ice. For long term storage, grains should have a moisture content of 10% or less. It is difficult to accurately measure this without special equipment.

About the only drawbacks to PETE plastics are that they are nearly always transparent to light, container volumes typically are limited to a gallon or less, and when used in conjunction with oxygen absorbers the sides will flex sufficiently to make stacking difficult though you could simply lay them on their sides.

It retains all of the nutrition and has a pleasant nutty flavor. From a nutritional standpoint it is by far the best, but it has one flaw: The essential oil in the germ is very susceptible to oxidation and soon goes rancid. As a result, brown rice has a shelf life 85 of only about six months unless given special packaging or storage. Freezing or refrigeration will greatly extend this. It’s possible to purchase brown rice from long term food suppliers already specially packaged in air tight containers with an inert nitrogen atmosphere or you can do it yourself.

Furthermore, a small amount of dietary fat is necessary for our bodies to properly absorb fat soluble vitamins like A,D,E and K.

These evaluations are personal and highly valuable to both pick skills and gear that are appropriate but to also exclude items that have little use. For instance, many people say they carry large knives on a daily basis as emergency gear, but I always wonder",

Skill Level and Whitewater Whitewater rivers and individual rapids are rated according to their degree of difficulty. A plus or minus sign is sometimes used to further refine the rating, for example Class III+ or Class IV-. Keep in mind that these ratings are subject to change because of rising water, which can increase or decrease the difficulty. Most rapids, however, are more difficult with a rise in water because the current gets faster and has a greater force.
