The total distance is the distance to the right of zero, plus the distance to the left of zero. Measuring Distance [3.7 km or 3700 m] PACING Counting the number of paces you have taken and converting the number of paces to metres is the most reliable method of measuring distance travelled. Before setting off you will need to work out exactly how many paces you walk per 100m so you can convert your paces to metres. Pacing is done by counting the number of paces that you take and recording them using a pace counter", "label": 0}

Another simple starting point in determining the general topography of an area is to use the flow of streams in conjunction with contours. Contour Patterns Each topographical feature such as a spur or a knoll is represented by its own particular contour pattern. Important Points The most important points to remember about contour patterns are – • Contour lines close together indicate steep slopes • Contour lines far apart indicate gentle slopes • Evenly spaced contour lines indicate uniform slopes • When the spacing of contour lines, reading from high to low, decreases, the slope is convex • When the spacing of contour lines, reading from high to low, increases, the slope is concave Contour Patterns 81", "label": 0}

To reduce the amount of fat in ground beef, heat the beef in a pan until it browns. Then put the beef in a colander, and pour one cup of warm water over the beef. Repeat with a second cup of warm water to rinse away fat melted by heating the beef. Use the ground beef in sauce and other dishes that do not require it to hold together. Finally, cooking makes beef safer by killing Salmonella and other organisms in the meat. As a result, cooking also serves as a natural preservative. According to the USDA, large pieces of fresh beef can be refrigerated for two or three days, then cooked and held safely for another day or two because the heat of cooking has reduced the number of bacteria on the surface of the meat and temporarily interrupted the natural cycle of deterioration.

First, blood vessels at the skin surface close down, or constrict. This does two things: (1) Less blood goes near the surface of the body so that less heat is lost to the outside.

Some wild creature may be caught in it, and if it is a trap, suffer hunger needlessly. The following traps and snares are but a few of the many which you can improvise with a little ingenuity.

However, you must make slight changes to reduce the chance of biological contamination. Do not build your shelter in depressions in the ground. Aerosol sprays tend to concentrate in these depressions. Avoid building your shelter in areas of vegetation, as vegetation provides shade and some degree of protection to biological agents. Avoid using vegetation in constructing your shelter. Place your shelter's entrance at a 90-degree angle to the prevailing winds. Such placement will limit the entry of airborne agents and prevent air stagnation in your shelter. Always keep your shelter clean.

If a family can use its shelter without having to go outside and be exposed to rain, snow, cold, or night problems, its dual use shelter will be a more valuable peacetime asset than a shelter not directly connected to the house. Furthermore, a directly connected shelter can be entered more quickly in a crisis, and probably will reduce post-attack exposures to fallout radiation received by persons carrying things into the shelter, or by those moving about post-attack to protect the home. The main disadvantages of a directly connected shelter are that it usually provides poorer protection against heat, smoke and carbon monoxide if the house burns and that it is more expensive to build than an earth-covered shelter with an outdoor walk-in entrance, such as the one illustrated in Figs.

Freezing changes the flavor and texture of fresh pork.

That’s why defrosted pork, like defrosted beef, veal, or lamb, may be drier and less tender than fresh meat. Curing, smoking, and aging. Curing preserves meat by osmotic action. The dry salt or a salt solution draws liquid out the cells of the meat and the cells of any microorganisms living on the meat. Smoking—hanging meat over an open fire—gives meat a rich, “smoky” flavor * Cooking pork in a microwave oven requires careful attention to the temperature.

In the mountains, as elsewhere, refilling each soldier's water containers as often as possible is mandatory.

Of all the physical problems encountered in a survival situation, the loss of water is the most preventable. The following are basic guidelines for the prevention of dehydration: • Always drink water when eating. Water is used and consumed as a part of the digestion process and can lead to dehydration. The body performs more efficiently in extreme conditions when acclimatized. • Conserve sweat not water. Limit sweat-producing activities but drink water. Until you find a suitable source, ration your water sensibly. A daily intake of 500 cubic centimeter (0.5 liter) of a sugar-water mixture (2 teaspoons per liter) will suffice to prevent severe dehydration for at least a week, provided you keep water losses to a minimum by limiting activity and heat gain or loss.

Only once in the past have I stayed in a debris hut during the winter, and I recall it being an uncomfortable and sleepless night. The true mistake I made was not building a poor shelter, but rather that I didn't get back out there to fix it, and do the process over again until it was perfect.

This is why you sweat when you work hard or PT. One quart of sweat, which you can easily produce in an hour of hard PT, will take about 600 calories of heat away from the body when it evaporates. When you inhale, the air you breathe in is warmed by the body and saturated with water vapor. Then when you exhale, that heat is lost. That is why breath can be seen in cold air. Respiration is really a combination of convection (heat being transferred to moving air by the lungs) and evaporation, with both processes occurring inside the body. PHYSICAL RESPONSES TO HEAT . When the body begins to create excess heat, it responds in several ways to rid itself of that heat. Initially, the blood vessels in the skin expand, or dilate. This dilation allows more blood to the surface where the heat can more easily be transferred to the surroundings.", "label": 0}

It is minimized by wearing insulative fabrics or with fabric that reflects the heat back to the body. m Evaporative Heat Loss occurs when perspiration (water) on the skin evaporates, drawing heat from the body. Minimizing the amount of sweating is important in reducing evaporative heat loss. In hot weather, on the other hand, evaporation is essential in cooling the body to prevent heat illnesses. - From The Backpackers Field Manual by Rick Curtis. Thermoregulation is balancing the heat a body loses to the environment with the heat generated from exercise. An example of proper thermoregulation is when heat production and heat retention are greater than the cold environment. If the environment is greater than heat production and heat retention then a person is susceptible to hypothermia or frostbite. Heat can be produced in the body by exercise and by shivering.

Storage Life of Dehydrated Foods Determining the storage life of foods is at best an inexact science as there are so many variables. These range from the condition your food was in when you first purchased it and includes many other factors. This page was written with input by Mr. Stephen Portela who has over 30 years of professional food storage experience. This information should be used as a general guide only, and should not be followed “as the gospel truth” because your results may be different. Four Factors that effect food storage: Factor #1: The Temperature: Temperature has more to do with how long well dried foods store than anything else. The USDA states, “Each 5.6 C.

If you do not have enough water for properly washing pots and pans, wipe clean with a paper towel, then sanitize them by soaking them in bleach water for two minutes. 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon is adequate for kitchen use.

Typical moisture content ranges from 40% - 60%. Ensiling is a process that involves taking fairly wet (moisture level between 40-60%) early growth green forage and putting it into silos or pits under airtight, anaerobic conditions. If moisture conditions get any higher, clostridial bacteria may grow. The harvested crop must be well chopped and placed in a pit and packed tightly together, driving out air so the anaer- obic fermentation process can begin. Fermentation will produce lactic acid, converting the high moisture forage plants to a stored energy food source. Producers may choose to routinely produce silage, or produce silage only when field drying is difficult or impossible.

As a result, elevated environmental temperature adds to the heat burden of the body and can interfere with heat dissipation. Heat Transfer Mechanisms.

The increasing voltage potential is always positive in direct relationship to negative ground potential during each pulse. The voltage polarity on the plates which create the voltage fields remains constant although the voltage charge increases. Positive and negative voltage “zones” are thus formed simultaneously in the electrical field of the capacitor plates. In the first stage of the process described in Table 1, because the water molecule naturally exhibits opposite electrical fields in a relatively polar configuration (the two hydrogen atoms have a positive charge while the oxygen atom has a negative charge), the voltage pulse causes the water molecules which were initially orientated in random directions, to spin and align themselves with the electrical field applied to the cell. The positively charged hydrogen atoms are attracted to the negative field while the negatively charged oxygen", "label": 0}

Materials that hold quantities of motionless or dead air are the best insulators, eg., wool and fur. The most practical method of insulating the body is to use clothing in the layer method. Several layers of medium weight clothing keep you warmer than one heavy garment even if the single heavy garment is as thick as the combined layers.

This includes medical care while trekking in third world countries, deep-water ocean sailing, isolated tramping and trekking, and following a large natural disaster or other catastrophe. The basic assumption is that trained doctors and hospital care will be unavailable for a prolonged period of time, and that in addition to providing first aid - definitive medical care and rehabilitation (if required) will need to be provided. Also the basics of personal and public hygiene will also need to be considered. Austere medicine is the provision of medical care without access to modern investigations or technology.

High turbidity -- greater than 20 nephelometric turbidity units (ntu) -- can quickly clog a slow sand filter, resulting in short periods between cleaning. This may be one reason why slow sand filters became unpopular in the early 20th century. There are simple remedies, however. Sedimentation tanks and gravel roughing filters are very effective at reducing turbidity. Roughing filters can reduce turbidity by 50 to 80 percent and can provide excellent pretreatment for slow sand filters.

(Breech loading guns were fired by touching off the priming with a slow match.) Today the slow match principle is used by many primitive people as a means of preserving fire and also as a means of carrying it from place to place. A slow match can be made by making a length of cord or thin rope (from 1/8\" to ¼ diameter) from suitable barks or palm fibres. Most of the 'silky' soft-fibred barks are ideal. When one end is put in fire or against a glowing coal it will take and hold the spark, smouldering slowly. A slow match is a safe way when you have no matches or fire-lighting material, to preserve the vital spark for further use after you have doused your fire and left camp for an hour or two.

Almost every time I have slept in a debris hut, the weather conditions have been mild and extremely forgiving. Only once in the past have I stayed in a debris hut during the winter, and I recall it being an uncomfortable and sleepless night. The true mistake I made was not building a poor shelter, but rather that I didn't get back out there to fix it, and do the process over again until it was perfect.

{"query": "maintain body heat in cold wet weather", "passage": "the body uses to cool itself down. This is why you sweat when you work hard or PT. One quart of sweat, which you can easily produce in an hour of hard PT, will take about 600 calories of heat away from the body when it evaporates. When you inhale, the air you breathe in is warmed by the body and saturated with water vapor. Then when you exhale, that heat is lost. That is why breath can be seen in cold air. Respiration is really a combination of convection (heat being transferred to moving air by the lungs) and evaporation, with both processes occurring inside the body. PHYSICAL RESPONSES TO HEAT . When the body begins to create excess heat, it responds in several ways to rid itself of that heat. Initially, the blood vessels in the skin expand, or dilate. This dilation allows more blood to the surface where the heat can more easily be transferred to the surroundings. Soon afterwards, sweating begins. This contributes to heat loss through convection and evaporation.", "label": 0}

Injuries resulting from burns, cuts, or other sources may require descent for effective treat- ment and healing. ACCLIMATIZATION 1-41. Altitude acclimatization involves physiological changes that permit the body to adapt to the effects of low oxygen saturation in the air. It allows sol- diers to achieve the maximum physical work performance possible for the al- titude to which they are acclimatized. Once acquired, acclimatization is main- tained as long as the soldier remains at that altitude, but is lost upon re- turning to lower elevations. Acclimatization to one altitude does not prevent altitude illnesses from occurring if ascent to higher altitudes is too rapid. Getting used to living and working at higher altitudes requires acclimatization. Figure 1-8 shows the four factors that affect acclimatization terrain. These factors are similar to those a scuba diver must consider, and the consequences of an error can be just as severe. In particular, high altitude climbing must be carefully paced and staged in the same way that divers must pace", "label": 0}

When planning a trap or snare, ask yourself how it should affect the prey, what is the source of power, and what will be the most efficient trigger. Your answers will help you devise a specific trap for a specific species. Traps are designed to catch and hold or to catch and kill. Snares are traps that incorporate a noose to accomplish either function. Simple Snare A simple snare (Figure 8-5) consists of a noose placed over a trail or den hole and attached to a firmly planted stake. If the noose is some type of cordage placed upright on a game trail, use small twigs or blades of grass to hold it up. Filaments from spider webs are excellent for holding nooses open.

A permanent family shelter can serve quite well for months as a post-attack temporary home if it is designed to provide adequate natural ventilation most of the time, to have adequate and easy forced ventilation by a KAP when forced ventilation is needed, and to have daylight illumination, A shelter dependent on ventilation laboriously pumped through pipes and on artificial lights even during daytime is much less practical for use as a post-attack home. The following instructions should enable a family having an earth-covered shelter with an emergency exit to make it much more livable for months-long occupancy.

The human body cools itself by evaporation (sweating), radiation (giving off heat from the body surface) and conduction (transferring heat from a warmer to a cooler surface). The first thing that can be done is to reduce the coverings over the body, such as clothing and bed linens. This allows for cooling via radiation.

In the past, mayonnaise, peanut butter and pickle jars have been designed for commercial use (one-time use only) and may not have been heat- treated. Unless jars are strong enough to withstand high temperatures, they may break when used for canning. However, some commercial companies are now using jars that are acceptable for home canning.

Cleanliness and sanitation when handling and preparing the food are also crucial. And, though drying vegetables isn't difficult to do, it demands plenty of careful attention. The vegetables must be stirred, the temperature checked, and tray positions changed about every half hour. That means you must be at home during the whole time it takes to dry your vegetables. Speed is of the essence when preparing foods to dry. For best results, vegetables should be blanched, cooled, and blotted dry within a very short time of harvesting. And you must never interrupt the drying process once it's begun. You can't cool partly dried food and then start it up again later, because there's a chance bacteria, molds, and yeasts will find a home in it.

Therefore, having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergency. A normally active person needs to drink at least two quarts (half gallon) of water each day. People in hot environments, children, nursing mothers, and ill people will require even more. You will also need water for food preparation and hygiene.

Despite the many nutritional advantages - which surpass western- style fast and processed foods - many fermented products are often associated with the stigma of being a “poor mans” food and as soon as a family can afford to buy processed foods it moves away from carrying out home fermentation (Holzapfel", "label": 0}

The human body cools itself by evaporation (sweating), radiation (giving off heat from the body surface) and conduction (transferring heat from a warmer to a cooler surface). The first thing that can be done is to reduce the coverings over the body, such as clothing and bed linens. This allows for cooling via radiation. Expose as much of the patient’s body surface as practical to open air. - 163 - Survival and Austere Medicine: An Introduction The two most commonly used non-pharmaceutical mechanisms used to reduce fever can be classified as wet and dry treatments.

Thick cuts, such as roasts, need long, slow cooking to gelatinize their connective tissue and keep the veal from drying out. A breast with bones, however, has more fat than a solid roast. Veal scallops and cutlets are the only kinds of veal that can be sauteed or broiled quickly. Storing This Food Refrigerate raw veal immediately, carefully wrapped to prevent its drippings from contami- nating the refrigerator shelves or other foods. Refrigeration prolongs the freshness of veal by slowing the natural multiplication of bacteria on the surface of meat. Unchecked, these bacteria will convert proteins and other substances on the surface of the meat to a slimy film. Eventually, they will also convert the meat’s sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cystine into smelly chemicals called mercaptans that interact with myoglobin to create the greenish pigment that gives spoiled meat its characteristic unpleasant appearance. Fresh veal will keep for three to five days in the refrigerator. As a general rule, large cuts of veal", "label": 0}

If you cannot identify a wild plant with 100% certainty as being one of the edible species NEVER use it as food. If you have the slightest hesitation over a plant's identity be safe and MOVE ON. Similarly, if you cannot remember which part of the plant is used leave it alone. Check your personal tolerance to ANY new edible wild plant before consuming in quantity. If you have a medical condition or are taking medication then you should seek professional medical advice before consuming edible wild plants as they may contain constituents that impair or amplify that medication. Be 'aware' of the environment that you are gathering from. Is there possible contamination from effluent, car exhaust emissions, sprays, dogs and so on?

Before you learn any new knot, consider the following: • The right knot is important. You want the strongest knot possible so that you don’t lose the fish. A simple overhand knot weakens line by about 50 percent. • Practice tying knots. Take a length of fishing line, a hook with the point cut off or buried into a cork, and practice. Practice until you can tie each knot correctly. • Wet knots with saliva as you pull them tight. This prevents damage to the line and allows the knot to pull tight. • Pull knots tight to prevent slippage. • Trim knots closely with a nail clipper. A good knot, pulled tight, will not come loose.

Eating wild plants is not as risky as some think, but it is also not something to be done carelessly. Positive identification is important because of the possibility of consuming poisonous look- alikes. It is also important to consume wild edible plants during the appropriate season, since some are unpalatable or even toxic out of season. Some wild edible plants should be eaten sparingly.

With enough time and energy, foraging for wild plants can reduce the amount of money you spend on food. Their abundance makes it possible to store plants for winter use by canning, freezing, and drying. ( Cautions Readers should take some basic precautions when eating wild plants. Eating wild plants is not as risky as some think, but it is also not something to be done carelessly. Positive identification is important because of the possibility of consuming poisonous look- alikes. It is also important to consume wild edible plants during the appropriate season, since some are unpalatable or even toxic out of season. Some wild edible plants should be eaten sparingly. A number of species in this guide contain oxalic acid, which is harmless when consumed in moderation, but can cause kidney stones and other health problems if consumed in excess, especially in the presence of underlying medical conditions. Not all areas are safe to forage. For example, railroad right-of- ways", "label": 0}

The output signal 58 of controller 56 is a binary signal (high or low) that is interpreted as an ON and OFF command for coil excitation. The power control circuit incorporates a solid state switch in the form of a power transistor or a MOSFET. It responds to the control signal 58 by turning the solid state switch ON and OFF to initiate and terminate coil excitation. Instantaneous voltage amplitude supplied to the coils during excitation is controlled by means of potentiometer P. Motor speed and torque are thus responsive to potentiometer adjustments.

Brine is made by combining salt with water in proportions to make either a weak, medium or strong solution. In some instances, salt is add directly to the food in the dry form and the brine is formed as juices are drawn out of the food. Vinegar, an acid, acts as a preserva- tive and contributes flavor different from the flavor produced by lactic acid fermentation that occurs during the brining process.

In cool weather pieces of meat can be safely dry salted for a couple of days or longer by rubbing a thick crust over all surfaces and placing the pieces where they can drain.

A lot of canning equipment is manufactured in the U.S. Therefore pressures and temperatures will be given both in metric and American measuring units (e.g. pounds/inch2 and degrees Fahrenheit). Principle and limitations The canning process involves placing foods in cans or jars and heating them to a temperature that destroys micro-organisms that could be a health hazard or cause the food to spoil. Canning also inactivates en- zymes that could cause the food to spoil. As the cans or jars are sealed hermetically, re-contamination from outside is prevented. In general, canned products can be stored for a long time without refrigeration. Chemical quality loss (in taste, colour and amount of certain essential nutrients) will slowly continue", "label": 0}

Drying also slows down the action of enzymes (naturally occurring substances which cause foods to ripen), but does not inactivate them.

(NOTE: Browning has one minor nutritional drawback. It breaks amino acids on the surface of the meat into smaller compounds that are no longer useful proteins.) When meat is heated, it loses water and shrinks. Its pigments, which combine with oxygen, are denatured (broken into fragments) by the heat. They turn brown, the natural color of well-done meat. At the same time, the fats in the meat are oxidized, a reaction that produces a characteristic warmed-over flavor when the cooked meat is refrigerated and then reheated. Cooking and storing the meat under a blanket of antioxidants—catsup or a gravy made of tomatoes, peppers and other vitamin-C rich vegetables—reduces fat oxidation and lessens the warmed-over flavor.

Cineole causes the induction of the enzymes involved in the detoxification of the liver. The effect of other drugs can therefore be reduced and/or shortened. Pediatric Use: Preparations containing the oil should not be applied to the faces of infants or small children, since glottal spasm, bronchial spasm and asthma-like attacks are possible, as is respiratory failure. OVERDOSAGE Overdosages of Niauli oil (more than 10 gm), can lead to life-threatening poisonings due to the high cineole content. Symptoms include, among others, fall in blood pressure, circulatory disorders, collapse and respiratory failure. In case of poisoning, vomiting should not be induced because of the danger of aspiration.

Tests of the Solar Funnel and Bowl Cookers in 2001 Christopher McMillan and Steven E. Jones Brigham Young University Introduction With an increase in population and a decrease in available fuels such as wood and coal in developing countries, the need for alternative cooking methods has increased. Solar cookers are an alternative to conventional methods such as wood-fires and coal-fires. They provide usable heat for cooking and pasteurising water, without the harmful side effects such as smoke inhalation that non-renewable sources create. In many countries such as Haiti, Bolivia and Kenya, the need for cheap, effective, and safe cooking methods has increased due to poverty and deforestation. Solar cookers are ideal because they rely on the sun’s free energy which is abundant in many of the world’s poorest countries.

In many places, the medicines are free. A woman taking ART should have regular health care visits about how the ART is affecting her health. When do women start ART? The best way to know when to start ART is by having a CD4 test, a blood test that measures the strength of the immune system. Most people start ART when their CD4 count is less than 350 (a healthy CD4 count is over 800). When CD4 tests are not available, ART may be started based on the kinds of illnesses a woman has. Women with HIV and tuberculosis should start ART 2 to 8 weeks after beginning treatment for tuberculosis, no matter what their CD4 count is.

The danger of dehydration is as prevalent in cold regions as it is in hot regions. In hot weather, the individual is aware of his body losing fluids through sweat. In cold weather, however, it is extremely difficult to realize that this condition exists since sweating is not as apparent as in a hot environment. The danger of dehydration in cold weather operations is a serious problem. In cold climates, sweat evaporates so rapidly or is absorbed so thoroughly by layers of heavy clothing that it is rarely visible on the skin. Dehydration also occurs during cold weather operations because drinking is inconvenient. Dehydration will weaken or incapacitate a casualty for a few hours, or sometimes, several days.
