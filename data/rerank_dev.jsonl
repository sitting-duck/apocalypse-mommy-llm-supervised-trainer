Map reading is a common method used, particularly in developed areas. Maps and aerial photos may be used when landmarks are clear. Using a compass in conjunction with maps and aerial photos is wise in areas without good landmarks. Navigation by dead reckoning is common in areas where landmarks are non- existent or inadequate. This method combines plotting and recording of a series of courses, measured by distance and direction from a starting point. * It is important to stay alert and observe all unusual landmarks. Difficulties in navigation may occur for several reasons. Some of these include WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE WOODS The most important thing to remember if you find yourself in this situation is not to panic. First, treat any injuries within your party. Next, establish that your basic needs are met. These include heat, shelter, water and food. Then consult your map and compass and try to recognize or remember landmarks you may have passed.", "label": 0}

Traditionally, slow sand filters have been made of concrete and pipe. The innovative use of molded polyethylene structures has distinct advantages. First, the engineering cost is reduced because it is amortized over the number of filters manufactured. Second, the cost of producing polyethylene filter vessels is much less than the construction and pouring of concrete forms. Finally, the materials used in polyethylene components can be certified as non-toxic, while materials for cast-in-place filters require testing of each installation. Additional advantages of polyethylene slow sand filters include transportability, durability and rapid set-up time.

Cooking and storing meat under a blanket of antioxidants—catsup or a gravy made of tomatoes, peppers, and other vitamin C-rich vegetables—reduces the oxidation of fats and the intensity of warmed-over flavor. Meat reheated in a microwave oven also has less warmed-over flavor. An obvious nutritional benefit of cooking is the fact that heat lowers the fat content of beef by liquifying the fat so it can run off the meat. One concrete example of how well this works comes from a comparison of the fat content in regular and extra-lean ground beef.

The standard commercial canning jar with a spring clamp and a rubber washer is watertight, but the metal clamp is vulnerable to corrosion. Therefore, a glass jar with a spring clamp and a rubber washer is an adequate expedient for short-term caching of small items, but it should not be relied upon to resist moisture for more than a year.

The basic assumption is that trained doctors and hospital care will be unavailable for a prolonged period of time, and that in addition to providing first aid - definitive medical care and rehabilitation (if required) will need to be provided. Also the basics of personal and public hygiene will also need to be considered. Austere medicine is the provision of medical care without access to modern investigations or technology.

Introduction 7 2 Storage life and spoilage 2.1 How long can fish or meat be kept? Fresh fish will spoil very quickly. Once the fish has been caught, spoilage progresses rapidly. In the high ambient temperatures of the tropics, fish will spoil within 12 hours. Using good fishing techniques (to ensure the fish is barely damaged) and cooling the fish, with the help on ice on board, can increase the storage life of fresh fish. The speed with which meat spoils not only depends on hygiene condi- tions and storage temperature, but also on the acidity of the meat and the structure of the muscular tissue. The firm muscular tissue of beef, for example, spoils less quickly than liver. Hygienic slaughtering and clean handling of the carcass have a positive effect on storage life.
